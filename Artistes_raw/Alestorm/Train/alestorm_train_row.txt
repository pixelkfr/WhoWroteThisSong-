Captain, there be vikings off the starboard bow!
Attack!

'Twas off some Caribbean shore,
While on an epic quest.
We came across a strange device!

A mystic portal into another time.
Where vikings ruled the land and sea!
Such mighty treasure they did hold.
We killed them all to steal their gold!

You put your faith in Odin and Thor!
We put ours in cannons and whores!
Your viking gods won't save you now,
When the pirates strike from the starboard bow!
Back through time, to fight the viking foe!
Back through time, where our voyage must now go!
Six hundred years into the the past,
Our destiny is here at last!
For infamy and plunder we will ride!

Their ships were powerless against our cannon fire.
We took no prisoners that day! (Yahaharr)

The Vikings prayed for mercy,
As we cut their throats!
But their worthless gods did not hear their cries!

You put your faith in Odin and Thor!
We put ours in cannons and whores!
Your viking gods won't save you now,
When the pirates strike from the starboard bow!
Back through time, to fight the viking foe!
Back through time, where our voyage must now go!
Six hundred years into the the past,
Our destiny is here at last!
For infamy and plunder we will ride!

Such mighty treasure they did hold.
We killed them all to steal their gold!

You put your faith in Odin and Thor!
We put ours in cannons and whores!
Your viking gods won't save you now,
When the pirates strike from the starboard bow!
Back through time, to fight the viking foe!
Back through time, where our voyage must now go!
Six hundred years into the the past,
Our destiny is here at last!
For infamy and plunder we will ride!


Go - the cold moonlight reflecting off your blade
So many centuries spent waiting for this day
Ride - across the seas beneath a blackened sail
Know that a painful death awaits us if we fail

Out of the darkness they came
With cannons a'raging and torches aflame
Slaying all poseurs who stand in their way

Black Sails at Midnight
You're dead by daylight
Black Sails at Midnight
Your fate - Too late

The time has come for you to face your darkest fears
Screams of agony are ringing in your ears
Die - a frenzied slaughter on the battlefield
Nowhere for you to run, tonight your fate is sealed

Out of the darkness they came
With cannons a'raging and torches aflame
Slaying all poseurs who stand in their way

Black Sails at Midnight
You're dead by daylight
Black Sails at Midnight
Your fate - Too late

From Scotland's bonnie shores we set sail
In search of alcohol, the drunkard's holy grail
'Cause a pirate's life is empty without booze
The situation's dire, we've got nothing to lose

To England we ride
With vengeance on our minds
We'll kill the monks, and get dead drunk
Come on lads it's cloister burning time

Buckfast Powersmash!
Buckfast Powersmash!
Buckfast Powersmash!
Buckfast Powersmash!

I'm not sure what's in it except for caffeine
Despite having drunk it since I was thirteen
It sells by the barrel in China and Spain
I'll get drunk once more on that Lurgan Champagne

Buckfast Powersmash!
Buckfast Powersmash!
Buckfast Powersmash!
Buckfast Powersmash! 
Countless years ago while lost in barren seas
There whispered murmurs of a bloody mutiny
We took up arms and slain the officers of rank
And with swords drawn made the captain walk the plank

And as he fell down to the depths
He swore a deadly curse
"As sure as hell's my final fate
You'll all soon die, or worse"
Now as we stand before the gallows
Waiting for the end
I'll say these final words my friend

At sunrise we'll all dance the hempen jig
So raise up your pint of rum and take another swig
The curse of Captain Morgan has led us to this fate
So have no fear, and don't look back, the afterlife awaits

We returned to port with sorrow in our chests
An evil shadow followed us on every quest
Never to feel joy again was our fate
Only misery and death, fear and burning hate

We broke the law, betrayed the code
Now time is running out
An unforgivable offence
Of that there is no doubt
Now as we stand before the gallows
Waiting for the end
I'll say these final words my friend

At sunrise we'll all dance the hempen jig
So raise up your pint of rum and take another swig
The curse of Captain Morgan has led us to this fate
So have no fear, and don't look back, the afterlife awaits

Many years have passed now
Yet the curse still lives on
And now we rot in a black prison cell
Waiting for our true calling in hell
But for the lives we leave behind
Don't shed a tear, don't cry
The only way to break this curse
Is for us all to die
Now as we stand before the gallows
Waiting for the end
I'll say these final words my friend

At sunrise we'll all dance the hempen jig
So raise up your pint of rum and take another swig
The curse of Captain Morgan has led us to this fate
So have no fear, and don't look back, the afterlife awaits

A thunderous crash in the dead of the night
We ready our weapons, prepare for the fight
My band of comrades, so cruelly betrayed
Now face the cold edge of justice's blade
They knew how to hit us, they knew where to look
Our fortress was breached and its mighty walls shook
Accused of this treason, I fled to the sea
To track down the true source of that treachery

Sold out, betrayed
Attacked, besieged
Outcast, accused
Honour, refused

Ride
The Black Spot in my hand
On a quest for the truth
I scour the land
This traitorous curr
Shall die by my hand
If I'm to be spared
I must have his head
I shall not rest 'til this traitor is dead

I called in all favours, I bartered and bribed
I must find this turncoat, and find him alive
And so I was taken to a little old inn
And deep in his cups, my man sat within
We bitterly battled, but I won the fight
And tied him beneath the high tide mark that night
And when I'd made sure he could no longer stand
I left him there with that Black Spot in his hand

Avenged, absolved
Justice, made right
Vengeance, deserved
Honour, preserved

As the lifeless corpse of my enemy floats in the bay, choked on salty brine, I swear a deadly oath.
By Poseidon's name, no traitor will go unpunished.
Hear these words and tremble, for our vengeance shall be swift and merciless! 
First light reflects off the ocean
All crew now set into motion
Another day like many before it
Hard life, no way to ignore it
Behold! A cry from the crow's nest
A ship appears from the south west
The years below deck that bored me
All lead to what lies before me

Hear the terror - Fires burn and cannons sound
Fate awaits me - As the vessels circle round
See the slaughter - Cutlass swings and pistols fire
Feel the anger - Raging through my body tires
One last battle - In this sailor's lonely war
Come to meet this - Destiny I can't ignore
I hold my breath - Close my eyes and hang on for
Death before the mast

Too late to lay low or outrun
Up close we're outmanned and outgunned
Prepare to rush forth, unleash hel
Cross swords in one final farewell
Hulls crash, our vessel is boarded
No mercy or tact is afforded
But now the King's men draw closer
Seems like it may all be over

Hear the terror - Fires burn and cannons sound
Fate awaits me - As the vessels circle round
See the slaughter - Cutlass swings and pistols fire
Feel the anger - Raging through my body tires
One last battle - In this sailor's lonely war
Come to meet this - Destiny I can't ignore
I hold my breath - Close my eyes and hang on for
Death before the mast 
O Flower of Scotland - When will we see
Yer like again - That fought and died for
Yer wee bit Hill and Glen - And stood against him
Proud Edward's Army - And sent him homeward
Tae think again

The Hills are bare now - Autumn leaves lie
lie thick and still - O'er land that is lost now
Which those so dearly held - That stood against him
Proud Edward's Army - And sent him homeward
Tae think again

Those days are past now - And in the past
they must remain - But we can still rise now
And be the nation again - That stood against him
Proud Edward's Army - And sent him homeward
Tae think again

O Flower of Scotland - When will we see
Yer like again - That fought and died for
Yer wee bit Hill and Glen - And stood against him
Proud Edward's Army - And sent him homeward
Tae think again


My friends I stand before you
To tell a truth most dire
There lurks a traitor in our midst
Who hath invoked the captain's ire

He don't deserve no mercy
We ought to shoot him with a gun
But I am not an evil man
So first let's have a little fun

We'll tie that scoundrel to a rope
And throw him overboard
Drag him underneath the ship
A terrifying deadly trip

Keelhaul that filthy landlubber
Send him down to the depths below
Make that bastard walk the plank
With a bottle of rum and a yo ho ho

I will not say what he has done
His sins are far too grave to tell
It's not my place to judge a man
But for them he will burn in hell

The sharks will dine upon his flesh
And Davy Jones will have his soul
Take his money and his hat
He won't need them where he's gonna go

But first lets tie him to a rope
And throw him overboard
Drag him underneath the ship
A terrifying deadly trip

Keelhaul that filthy landlubber
Send him down to the depths below
Make that bastard walk the plank
With a bottle of rum and a yo ho ho 
Legend speaks of a beast
Three hundred miles from its tip to its tail
None have seen it, yet all know its name
Like the ark of the covenant, or the holy grail

We set out on a quest
In search of the lair, where the creature doth dwell
On a ransom to bring back its head
Our journey would take us to the depths of hell

His eyes shine like the rays of morning
His mouth is as a burning flame

Leviathan
Cresting the waves
Leading us all to the grave
Leviathan
Slaying all foes
Who dare to oppose
Tearing bodies limb from limb
Eviscerating on a whim

The skies turned to black
The oceans fell dead, no winds dared to blow
Then out the darkness with a thunderous roar
Leviathan rose up from the depths below

Cannons fired, and swords tasted blood
As the beast turned to strike with rage in its eyes
From its mouth came a great ball of flame
It was then we all knew, that the end was nigh

His eyes shine like the rays of morning
His mouth is as a burning flame

Leviathan
Cresting the waves
Leading us all to the grave
Leviathan
Slaying all foes
Who dare to oppose
Tearing bodies limb from limb
Eviscerating on a whim

His eyes shine like the rays of morning
His mouth is as a burning flame
His nostrils seethe with fumes of brimstone
He is the beast that can't be tamed

Leviathan
Cresting the waves
Leading us all to the grave
Leviathan
Slaying all foes
Who dare to oppose

Leviathan
Cresting the waves
Leading us all to the grave
Leviathan
Slaying all foes
Who dare to oppose
Tearing bodies limb from limb
Eviscerating on a whim


Who's that short man what does he do?
He killed that monkey with his shoe!
Why that monkey? Why his boot?
'Cause he had a belly full of loot!

The monkey needs his damn revenge!
That poor creature we'll avenge!

Midget Saw, a deadly fate
Chopped up limbs become shark bait
Midget Saw, the pirate's code
It says that both your legs must go
Chopped to pieces
Ripped to shreds
You're gonna wish that you were dead!

Grab him by his manky hair
And strap him to that table there
This pirate's not gonna walk again
He's in for a world of nasty pain!

Slap that midget with an oar
Remove his legs with a saw!

Midget Saw, a deadly fate
Chopped up limbs become shark bait
Midget Saw, the pirate's code
It says that both your legs must go
Chopped to pieces
Ripped to shreds
You're gonna wish that you were dead!

Midget Saw, a deadly fate
Chopped up limbs become shark bait
Midget Saw, the pirate's code
It says that both your legs must go
Chopped to pieces
Ripped to shreds
You're gonna wish that you were dead! 
I know of a tavern not far from here
Where you can get some mighty fine beer
The company's true and the wenches are pretty
It's the greatest damn place in the whole of the city
If you're looking for crewmates, you'll sure find 'em there
Cutthroats and lowlifes and worse i should dare
Ol' Nancy don't care who comes to her inn
It's a den of debauchery violence and sin

So come take a drink and drown your sorrows
And all of our fears will be gone till tomorrow
We'll have no regrets and live for the day
In Nancy's Harbour Cafe

If you're looking to go on a glorious quest
There's a man there who knows of an old treasure chest
For some pieces of eithe an a tankard of ale
He'll show you the map and tell you it's tale
And then there's Nancy, the lovely barmaiden
She may be old but her beauty ain't fading
Ol' Nancy don't care who comes to her inn
It's a den of debaucher violence and sin

So come take a drink and drown your sorrows
And all of our fears will be gone till tomorrow
We'll have no regrets and live for the day
In Nancy's Harbour Café

A dreaded curse - Is spoken of
By all men of the sea - An ancient tale
Of pirate's woe - And sailor's tragedy

A map was drawn - By grizzled men
Forgotten years ago - A chest of glory
And mortal sin - The none should ever know

And they searched and they searched
And they searched and they searched
For forbidden treasure old
And this curse, and this curse,
and this curse, and this curse
Will forever now be told

A pirate captain - Of many years
Had heard these whispers grim - But lust for treasure
And endless wealth - Had all but blinded him

He hired a crew - Of hardy men
To help him in his cause - They never knew
The danger of - This bounty's evil force

And they searched and they searched
And they searched and they searched
For forbidden treasure old
And this curse, and this curse,
and this curse, and this curse
Will forever now be told

Now stormy nights - When moon is full
Will herald in their call - A ghostly crew
Who loot and kill - 'til all before them fall
Now listen, lad - Remember this
When foul winds blow agale - Lest shadow come
And write your name - In adage to this tale

Many moons ago, in a faraway land
We met an old man with a hook for a hand
He showed us a map that lead to treasure untold
He said, "I'll give ye the map, if ye give me some gold"

For some pieces of eight the deal was done
He gave us the map, our quest had begun
We gathered our crew and set sail on the waves
And we knew we'd be rich by the end of the day

Now we're sailing over oceans and seas
With a lust for gold and the power of steel

Over the seas, we shall ride
Searching for treasure, into the night
Over the seas, our quest has begun
And we will not stop with the dawn of the sun

Through treacherous seas we reached the lost isle
And over it's shores we marched for many miles
Until we discovered where the treasure did lie
With gold coins and jewels gleaming inside

Now we're sailing over oceans and seas
With a lust for gold and the power of steel

Over the seas, we shall ride
Searching for treasure, into the night
Over the seas, our quest has begun
And we will not stop with the dawn of the sun

Over the seas, we shall ride
Searching for treasure, into the night
Over the seas, our quest is done

And we will be home by the dawn of the sun 
Though you see me now a mere ghost of a man
I once had the heart of a lion
Commanded my ship between many a shore
The ol' Jolly Roger a-flyin

Mine was a name that struck fear into men
And regret into plenty of lasses
Oh, how I wish I could take back those days
As I stare at these empty beer-glasses

I think of the times past when I had it all
I toyed with men's wives and their daughters
And in my pursuit of this ill-gotten wealth
I stabbed and I slashed and I slaughtered.

And for what?
The men that I've fought
Are matched by the number of women I've bought
And for what?
I've killed and I've shot
And reddened the cold tears of children with blood
And If I could go back and make my amends
I'd make all those mistakes again
I'd kill every last one of those bastards, my friend

My ship was the last sight that many would see
As we narrowed the gap with our quarry
The sound of the cannons and splintering wood
Would herald our paths into glory

We seized all the bounty and scuppered the ship
Our hearts hadn't time for the wounded
I took my share and the crew got the rest
And on into port we then bounded

Life has many pleasures, and we had our fill
Of food and of wenches and beer
When we'd tired of the port or had drunken it dry
The time to set sail would come near

And for what?
We heeded no law
Made other men suffer so we could have more
And for what?
We lived every day
With the noose of the hangman a hair's breadth away
And If I could go back and make my amends
I'd make all those mistakes again
I'd kill every last one of those bastards, my friend

Oh I have seen wonders you'd never have dreamed,
And taken my fair share, I must say
Holds full of booty I happily seized
From crews who would not see a new day

Spanish gold came and went, gem stones got sold,
But I knew more lay on the horizon,
Yet the beer was too good and the gals were too sweet
And now in my old age it's gone

These memories were bought with the lives of good men
A price that I paid without scruple
So many souls suffered so I could get drunk
And swagger from brothel to brothel

And for what?
It's been many years
Yet the screams of the vanquished still ring in my ears
And for what?
I've blood on my hands
I wait for my place in the halls of the damned
And If I could go back and make my amends
I'd make all those mistakes again
I'd kill every last one of those bastards, my friend

For many a-year we have travelled the seas,
Singing songs about pirates and all their misdeeds!
Stories of treasure and great undead foes,
Just a day in the life of a man that I know.

Your legendary prowess in drinking much beer
Recorded in song for all people to hear.
But many have asked where we're next gonna sail
The answer lies deep in a barrel of ale!

There are no more tales to be told!
No more stories from battles of old!
Now it seems our journey has come to an end!
We are scraping the barrel my friend!
There are no more tales to be told!
No more stories from battles of old!
Now it seems our journey has come to an end!
We are scraping the barrel my friend!

You may think you've heard all this music before,
That Running Wild did it back in '84
But times are a-changing and we don't give a damn!
So if you don't like it, go start your own band!

Many have told us that we can't go on!
That one day we'll run out of lyrics for songs!
But when the time comes to write album four,
We'll scrape at the barrel once more!

There are no more tales to be told!
No more stories from battles of old!
Now it seems our journey has come to an end!
We are scraping the barrel my friend!

There are no more tales to be told!
No more stories from battles of old!
Now it seems our journey has come to an end!
We are scraping the barrel my friend!There are no more tales to be told!
No more stories from battles of old!
Now it seems our journey has come to an end!
We are scraping the barrel my friend!
There are no more tales to be told!
No more stories from battles of old!
Now it seems our journey has come to an end!
We are scraping the barrel my friend! 
We set sail at first light
Questing for steel with power and might
For countless days we ride the waves
The battle lies ahead
Our coming they do dread
We raise the black flag
And ready our attack

Fire the cannons, storm the walls
We will see this city fall
Show no mercy in the fight
The sky will burn with blood this night

Set Sail and conquer - On a quest to distant lands
Set Sail and conquer - Destiny is in our hands
To the heart of battle ride - The gods are on our side
We'll sail and conquer 'til we die

A reign of blood and slaughter
We show our foes no quarter
Taking their lives and watching them die
We leave our fears behind
Only treasure on our minds
For tonight we raise a hail
In death or victory

Fire the cannons, storm the walls
We will see this city fall
Show no mercy in the fight
The sky will burn with blood this night

Set Sail and conquer - On a quest to distant lands
Set Sail and conquer - Destiny is in our hands
To the heart of battle ride - The gods are on our side
We'll sail and conquer 'til we die 
It's 3 years to the very day,
since a pirate captain said to me,
hey lad come join our crew,
adventure and glory waits for you!

I took his words as gold,
and set sail for quests untold with a bottle of rum,
in my hand I dreamed of wealth and foreign lands!

Hey! you're banjaxed! Hey! you're screwed!
and death is coming for you!
trapped on an island lost at sea!
shipwrecked you'll cease to be!

Hey! you're banjaxed! Hey! you're screwed!
and death is coming for you!
trapped on an island lost at sea!
shipwrecked your destiny!

On the 16th night at sea,
in the depths of toil and misery,
we struck a hidden reef,
and our ship began to sink beneath,

I grabbed some drifting wood,
and held on as long as I could,
'til I landed on a desert isle,
now I'm stuck here 'til the day I die!

Hey! you're banjaxed! Hey! you're screwed!
and death is coming for you!
trapped on an island lost at sea!
shipwrecked you'll cease to be!

Hey! you're banjaxed! Hey! you're screwed!
and death is coming for you!
trapped on an island lost at sea!
shipwrecked your destiny!

Shipwrecked! Shipwrecked! Get drunk or die!
Shipwrecked! Shipwrecked! Get Drunk or die!

Hey! you're banjaxed! Hey! you're screwed!
and death is coming for you!
trapped on an island lost at sea!
shipwrecked you'll cease to be!

Hey! you're banjaxed! Hey! you're screwed!
and death is coming for you!
trapped on an island lost at sea!
shipwrecked your destiny! 
A ship approaches off the starboard bow
The time has come to fight, the time to strike is now
Reload the cannons, and sharpen up your swords
They will regret the day they faced the pirate horde

Who will survive no-one can tell
Come on, lets give 'em hell

Terror on the High Seas
Terror on the High Seas

A flash of thunder lights up the midnight sky
Fifty dead across the deck as the ships draw side by side
Raise up your cutlasses and quest into the fight
A reign of terror we shall bring unto our foes this night

Who will survive no-one can tell
Come on, lets give 'em hell!

Terror on the High Seas
Terror on the High Seas
A reign of terror on the seas
We'll bring these poseurs to their knees

And now the time has come to die
Your destiny is nigh 
Many a year I have worked in these parts
Running this inn that ain't marked on no charts
Though its location to many is known
If you're to find it you have to be shown
Through methods long hidden we carefully craft
A beverage to rival the Huntmaster's draught
The mere smell of which, the Gods would entice
And them that know call it that Famous Ol' Spiced

Here sits a man, a smuggler by trade
A-boastin' of all of the money he's made
Runnin' his liquor to here and to there
Travellin' all over and peddlin' his wares
He says he's had beers from Prussia and wines
Taken from all of the very best vines
But none of these tipples could ever suffice
So I'll bring him a jug of that Famous Ol' Spiced

Oh, pour me a slug of it
Throw me a mug of it
Bring me a jug of that Famous Ol' Spiced

In walks a sailor all battered and blue
Fallen afoul of his captain and crew
They'd pulled in to port, their cargo was stacked
But three hours later he's caught in the act
Acquainting himself with the skipper's own wife
This fool was lucky to leave with his life
He's not here for doctors or friendly advice
He just wants a jug of that Famous Ol' Spiced

Oh, pour me a slug of it
Throw me a mug of it
Bring me a jug of that Famous Ol' Spiced

For men of the sea go as fast as they come
And leave little more than the tales they have spun
So sing me your sermon and pay me my price
And I'll give you a jug of that Famous Ol' Spiced

Oh, pour me a slug of it
Throw me a mug of it
Bring me a jug of that Famous Ol' Spiced 
In a time when men knew the meaning of fear
And the tyrants of hell ruled the land and the seas
There lived one man who was true
Guardian of secrets that only he knew
Condemned for a crime that he did not commit
Sentenced to die in the depths of the pit
He swore he would take his revenge
Every laster traitor, their lives he would end

With the power of ale - He could not fail

Sail into battle, glory and metal

Hail! - Huntmaster
Ride! - Huntmaster
Fight! - Huntmaster
Die! - Huntmaster

Up from the bowels of hell he sailed
Wielding a tankard of freshly brewed ale
Slaying all those in his path
Those who might hinder his god-given task
To bring back beer to the lands of the free
This is his quest, his true destiny
Legends shall speak of his name
Hail the Huntmaster, with honour and fame

With the power of ale - He could not fail

Sail into battle, glory and metal

Hail! - Huntmaster
Ride! - Huntmaster
Fight! - Huntmaster
Die! - Huntmaster

This is the hunter's badge of glory
That he protects and tends his quarry
Hunts with honor, as is due
And through the beast to the Gods is true 
From lands across the sea we have returned once more
With countless treasures plundered from those distant shores
But now the time has come, our destiny at hand
With cannonfire and battlecry we will reclaim this land

Misery and slaughter we left burning in our wake
A legacy of torment is rightfully ours to take

We sail the endless oceans
We sail the raging seas
The quest is never ending
It leads us to destiny

The endless quest is calling us another time
The jolly roger in the sky is our sign
The mountains shook, the seas began to boil
As we set out again to conquer foreign soil

Misery and slaughter we left burning in our wake
A legacy of torment is rightfully ours to take

We sail the endless oceans
We sail the raging seas
The quest is never ending
It leads us to destiny 
There lies a tavern down Wisconsin Way
Where you can get drunk any time of the day
The landlord's a bastard, the barmaid's a whore
But give them no shit or you're straight out the door

The Sunk'n Norwegian's the name of this hole
A nasty ol' tavern if ever I've known

One more drink at the Sunk'n Norwegian
One more drink before we have to die
One more drink at the Sunk'n Norwegian
Raise up your tankards of ale to the sky
One more drink, at the Sunk'n Norwegian
One more drink, before we have to die
One more drink, at the Sunk'n Norwegian
Raise up your tankards of ale to the sky

Scoundrels and brigands and ne'er-do-wells
And creatures dragged up from the black pits of hell
You'll find the relief in a tankard of ale
So the Sunk'n Norwegian is where we will sail

For barrels of whiskey or pints from the bar
But if you don't know
Then you don't go

Drink up my friends, as much as you can
For tomorrow we sail to a faraway land
We'll party all night and get drunk off our heads
'Cause we can all rest when we are dead

One more drink at the Sunk'n Norwegian
One more drink before we have to die
One more drink at the Sunk'n Norwegian
Raise up your tankards of ale to the sky
One more drink, at the Sunk'n Norwegian
One more drink, before we have to die
One more drink, at the Sunk'n Norwegian
Raise up your tankards of ale to the sky
One more drink at the Sunk'n Norwegian
One more drink before we have to die
One more drink at the Sunk'n Norwegian
Raise up your tankards of ale to the sky
One more drink, at the Sunk'n Norwegian
One more drink, before we have to die
One more drink, at the Sunk'n Norwegian
Raise up your tankards of ale to the sky

Another day goes by, another setting sun
As the light begins to fade
Upon this silent ship I now chart a course
Yet no wind blows these tattered sails
For reasons lost to time, that I cannot recall
Alone I sail the endless seas
The hands of fate have slain the crew, my only friends
And soon this doom will come for me

And I look back and wonder
Of the times we once shared

I stand here alone on the bow of the ship
Counting the hours 'til I die
Abandoned to fate with no chance of return
I raise up my fist to the sky
But know that these days were the best of our lives
And nothing can take that away
So when we are dead we will all meet again
And fight to the end of our days

Many years have I wandered
Alone and afraid
It seems now I've found a reason to live
As I stare at my grave

I ride the endless tide that's carried me so long
Heavy heart and broken soul
Would this have always been? Is this destiny?
I raise my head and onwards go.

And I know that the end comes
There's no reason to be scared

I stand here alone on the bow of the ship
Counting the hours 'til I die
Abandoned to fate with no chance of return
I raise up my fist to the sky
But know that these days were the best of our lives
And nothing can take that away
So when we are dead we will all meet again
And fight to the end of our days 
When I come back from a mighty quest
I have no need for sleep or rest
I head to a tavern for a drink
And get so drunk I cannot think
A wench by my side and a jug of mead
These are the things that I most need
So I sit back and sing this song
And drink and party all night long

Hey! Hey!
I want more wenches
Hey! Hey!
More wenches and mead
Hey! Hey!
I want more wenches
Lots of wenches is what I need

When I come back from a mighty quest
I have no need for sleep or rest
I head to a tavern for a drink
And get so drunk I cannot think
A wench by my side and a jug of mead
These are the things that I most need
So I sit back and sing this song
And drink and party all night long

Hey! Hey!
I want more wenches
Hey! Hey!
More wenches and mead
Hey! Hey!
I want more wenches
Lots of wenches is what I need 
With a hi hi ho and a hi hi hey!
We're hoisting the flag to be free
We will steal the show, Jolly Rogers go
We are wolves of the sea

Don't try to run, it's all said and done
There's a treasure in sight
We are robbing you blind I hope you don't mind
We are taking it all tonight

Just walk away we will conquer it all
Pirates will stand and the loser will fall

With a hi hi ho and a hi hi hey
We're bound to be close to the sea
Our captain will stand on the bridge and sing
Pirates are all we can be

With a hi hi ho and a hi hi hey!
We're hoisting the flag to be free
We will steal the show, Jolly Rogers go
We are wolves of the sea

Down to the core we're coming for more
With a sword close at hand
We are scary and bold, with a chest full of gold
We get sea legs when sighting land

The hook of our captain is looking at you
There's no Peter Pan so what can you do

With a hi hi ho and a hi hi hey
We're bound to be close to the sea
Our captain will stand on the bridge and sing
Pirates are all we can be

With a hi hi ho and a hi hi hey!
We're hoisting the flag to be free
We will steal the show, Jolly Rogers go
We are wolves of the sea

With a hi hi ho and a hi hi hey
We're bound to be close to the sea
Our captain will stand on the bridge and sing
Pirates are all we can be

With a hi hi ho and a hi hi hey!
We're hoisting the flag to be free
We will steal the show, Jolly Rogers go
We are wolves of the sea

With a hi hi ho and a hi hi hey
We're bound to be close to the sea
Our captain will stand on the bridge and sing
Pirates are all we can be

With a hi hi ho and a hi hi hey!
We're hoisting the flag to be free
We will steal the show, Jolly Rogers go
We are wolves of the sea
We are wolves of the sea
