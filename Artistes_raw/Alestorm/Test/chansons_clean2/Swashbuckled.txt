gather round and listen.
as i tell you now this tale.
the grim legacy of the pirates three.
and how their lives ceased to be.
i will tell you know of redrum.
the ginger commodore.
he got a case of the scurvy rot.
and then that bastard was no more.
this is the tale of captain crashride.
by his crew condemned and damned.
and as if this wasn t bad enough.
they replaced him with a baldy man.
now his ghost haunts the sea.
eternally he s doomed to wander.
mayhaps you will hear his deathly cry.
c mon son buy a honda.
to the end of time we will sail the seas.
with cutlasses in hand.
we will terrorize the land.
though the hands of fate may strike us down.
we will fight til we fall.
swashbucklers til we die.
this is the tale of admiral nobeard.
the fattest pirate in the west.
he s never seen his balls before.
and he needs a bra to hold his breasts.
feared by friend and foe alike.
no sword nor gun could wound his flesh.
but one day he met his fate.
twas on a pretzel he choked to death.
to the end of time we will sail the seas.
with cutlasses in hand.
we will terrorize the land.
though the hands of fate may strike us down.
we will fight til we fall.
swashbucklers til we die.
we will fight til we fall.
swashbucklers til we die.
