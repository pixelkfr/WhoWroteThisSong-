the time has come.
the time for a drink.
but i don t want whiskey or gin.
there s only one drink.
that gets me so drunk.
until my head starts to spin.
far to the west.
under tropical sun.
this mystical drink is brewed.
on our mission to get totally drunk.
we have got nothing to lose.
rum is the power.
rum is the key.
rum is the thing that will set us free.
rum rum rum yarr.
rum rum ahoy.
rum rum rum yarr.
rum rum gimme more rum.
rum rum rum yarr.
rum rum ahoy.
rum rum rum yarr.
rum rum ya ha ha ha.
the time has come.
the time for a drink.
but i don t want vodka or mead.
none of these drinks will quench my thirst.
rum is the drink that i need.
questing the oceans and questing the seas.
searching for ultimate booze.
on our mission to get totally drunk.
we have got nothing to lose.
rum is the power.
rum is the key.
rum is the thing that will set us free.
rum rum rum yarr.
rum rum ahoy.
rum rum rum yarr.
rum rum gimme more rum.
rum rum rum yarr.
rum rum ahoy.
rum rum rum yarr.
rum rum.

rum rum rum yarr.

rum rum rum yarr.
rum rum gimme more rum.
rum rum rum yarr.
