i come to you from another time.
with a message that everyone must die.
at the hand of undead squids from space.
they will crush your skull and smash your face.
we saved the past from vikings.
now the future is unclear.
we must travel through time again.
and save the world with beer.
we are class you are not.
let s kill some squids and make them rot.
with pirate powered murder skills.
the future s where we get our thrills.
a shot to the heart with a flintlock gun.
and mash their brains with a bottle of rum.
we are class you are not.
from the past we have returned.
we are here to make those bastards burn tonight.
fueled by rum and lust to kill.
we have the power and the will to fight.
hey marty it s your kids.
they get devoured by undead squids.
lest the world be torn asunder.
to the future we must plunder.
we are class you are not.
let s kill some squids and make them rot.
with pirate powered murder skills.
the future s where we get our thrills.
a shot to the heart with a flintlock gun.
and mash their brains with a bottle of rum.
we are class you are not.
