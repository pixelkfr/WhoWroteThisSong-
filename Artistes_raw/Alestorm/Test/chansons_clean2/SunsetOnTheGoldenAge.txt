inside of aeons from chaotic spires.
a shell of frozen time.
where beats the silent ocean.
of shadows turned sublime.
forces of inspiring luminescence.
guide the hidden way.
i know that it will take me to.
another golden age.
sundered from daylight by the rage of the unseen.
betwixt carbonic plateaus where rarity convenes.
under the heat of a thousand suns destruction is attained.
when flows the red and ochre histories ingrained.
legends pass and time ticks on entropy prevails.
into the endless darkness every ship must sail.
ouroboros uncoiled the circle ends tonight.
one thousand years of history banished from all sight.
the sun will set forever.
never to rise again.
and in the coming darkness.
we will fight to the bitter end.
our legend passed from memory.
it s time to turn the page.
the sun has set upon the golden age.
the final chapter the end is close at hand.
across the boundary where ocean meets the sand.
embrace the anatine forsake all that you know.
the tenebrous cosmic sphere where all of us must go.
inside of aeons from chaotic spires.
a shell of frozen time.
where beats the silent ocean.
of shadows turned sublime.
forces of inspiring luminescence.
guide the hidden way.
i know that it will take me to.
another golden age.
the sun will set forever.
never to rise again.
and in the coming darkness.
we will fight to the bitter end.
our legend passed from memory.
it s time to turn the page.
the sun has set now night is falling.
never again to hear the calling.
the sun has set upon the golden age.
