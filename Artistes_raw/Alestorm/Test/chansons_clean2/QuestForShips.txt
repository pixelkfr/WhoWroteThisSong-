i know a place at the edge of the land.
where the grass runs out and turns into sand.
i know a place where a man can t stand.
cos a man can t walk in the sea.
i know a place where a man can t go.
where a man would drown and sink below.
but if you have a ship then you should know.
that you can come with me.
come with me on a quest.
i am on a quest a quest for ships.
sailing s how i get my kicks.
i am on a quest a quest for boats.
i am mad for anything that floats.
i am on a quest to find a craft.
a barge or bark or dinghy or raft.
i am on a quest a quest for ships.
and now i need my fix.
i know a place where we can sail.
a place i heard of once in a tale.
no gems no gold no holy grail.
a place at the end of the sea.
but there s one problem i can see.
i have no ship that could take me.
but if you have one or two or three.
then you can come with me.
come with me on a quest.
i am on a quest a quest for ships.
sailing s how i get my kicks.
i am on a quest a quest for boats.
i am mad for anything that floats.
i am on a quest to find a craft.
a barge or bark or dinghy or raft.
i am on a quest a quest for ships.
won t return til i have had my fix.
