sailing the raging seas.
to distant lands unknown.
porto bello fell in a day.
now britannia rules the waves.
thirty thousand men at arms.
red ensign in the sky.
to cartagena we set sail.
with blood and plunder we will prevail.
twice struck and twice we have failed.
but third time works a charm.
the greatest fleet the world has seen.
to fight the war of jenkins ear.
waters lash across the bow.
through caribbean seas.
the year is 1741.
the final battle has begun.
the skies are burning with thunder.
the seas are ablaze with flame.
set the course for cartagena.
the sands of time will remember our names.
the skies are burning with thunder.
the seas are ablaze with flame.
set the course for cartagena.
history is written today.
across the sea lashed deck.
our captain gives a cry.
cartagena lies ahead.
the spanish foe will soon be dead.
portents of coming doom.
engulf the battle line.
high above the heavens sigh.
a red light burning in the sky.
an omen of dread.
which no man can deny.
the legends hold true.
we must turn back or die.
superstitious fools.
be gone from my sight.
blast the trumpets of war.
and prepare for the fight.
the skies are burning with thunder.
the seas are ablaze with flame.
set the course for cartagena.
the sands of time will remember our names.
the skies are burning with thunder.
the seas are ablaze with flame.
set the course for cartagena.
history is written today.
hard to starboard.
man the cannons.
and on my command unleash hell.
fire show them your steel.
bring them to death on the battlefield.
ride on the wind and conquer the foe.
the legends be damned to our deaths we will ago.
the skies are burning with thunder.
the seas are ablaze with flame.
set the course for cartagena.
the sands of time will remember our names.
the skies are burning with thunder.
the seas are ablaze with flame.
set the course for cartagena.
history is written today.
