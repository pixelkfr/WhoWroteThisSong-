piracy s a crime and crime doesn t pay.
and we go home poor at the end of the day.
but i d rather live my life in rags.
than be taped to a desk with a wife that s a hag.
we live each day like there s nothing to lose.
but a man has needs and that need is booze.
they say all the best things in life are free.
so give all your beer and your rum to me.
we are here to drink your beer.
and steal your rum at the point of a gun.
your alcohol to us will fall.
cause we are here to drink your beer.
we are here to drink your beer.
and steal your rum at the point of a gun.
your alcohol to us will fall.
cause we are here to drink your beer.
drink.
we sailed over seas for wenches and mead.
and told great tales of the huntmaster s deeds.
the quest for a drop of the famous ol spiced.
has shown us the wrath of leviathan s bites.
we went back through time to get more rum.
though we end up shipwrecked having no fun.
but heavy metal pirates we must be.
so give all your beer and your rum to me.
we are here to drink your beer.
and steal your rum at the point of a gun.
your alcohol to us will fall.
cause we are here to drink your beer.
