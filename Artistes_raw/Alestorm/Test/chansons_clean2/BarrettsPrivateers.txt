oh the year was 1778.
how i wish i was in sherbrooke now.
a letter of marque came from the king.
to the scummiest vessel i d ever seen.
god damn them all.
i was told we d cruise the seas for american gold.
we d fire no guns shed no tears.
now i am a broken man on a halifax pier.
the last of barrett s privateers.
oh elcid barrett cried the town.
how i wish i was in sherbrooke now.
for twenty brave men all fishermen who.
would make for him the antelope s crew.
god damn them all.
i was told we d cruise the seas for american gold.
we d fire no guns shed no tears.
now i am a broken man on a halifax pier.
the last of barrett s privateers.
the antelope sloop was a sickening sight.
how i wish i was in sherbrooke now.
she d a list to the port and her sails in rags.
and the cook in scuppers with the staggers and the jags.
god damn them all.
i was told we d cruise the seas for american gold.
we d fire no guns shed no tears.
now i am a broken man on a halifax pier.
the last of barrett s privateers.
on the king s birthday we put to sea.
how i wish i was in sherbrooke now.
we were 91 days to montego bay.
pumping like madmen all the way.
god damn them all.
i was told we d cruise the seas for american gold.
we d fire no guns shed no tears.
now i am a broken man on a halifax pier.
the last of barrett s privateers.
on the 96th day we sailed again.
how i wish i was in sherbrooke now.
when a bloody great yankee hove in sight.
with our cracked four pounders we made to fight.
god damn them all.
i was told we d cruise the seas for american gold.
we d fire no guns shed no tears.
now i am a broken man on a halifax pier.
the last of barrett s privateers.
the yankee lay low down with gold.
how i wish i was in sherbrooke now.
she was broad and fat and loose in the stays.
but to catch her took the antelope two whole days.
god damn them all.
i was told we d cruise the seas for american gold.
we d fire no guns shed no tears.
now i am a broken man on a halifax pier.
the last of barrett s privateers.
ladies and gentlemen mister heri joensen.
then at length we stood two cables away.
how i wish i was in sherbrooke now.
our cracked four pounders made an awful din.
but with one fat ball the yank stove us in.
god damn them all.
i was told we d cruise the seas for american gold.
we d fire no guns shed no tears.
now i am a broken man on a halifax pier.
the last of barrett s privateers.
the antelope shook and pitched on her side.
how i wish i was in sherbrooke now.
barrett was smashed like a bowl of eggs.
and the maintruck carried off both me legs.
god damn them all.
i was told we d cruise the seas for american gold.
we d fire no guns shed no tears.
now i am a broken man on a halifax pier.
the last of barrett s privateers.
so here i lay in my 23rd year.
how i wish i was in sherbrooke now.
it s been 6 years since we sailed away.
and i just made halifax yesterday.
god damn them all.
i was told we d cruise the seas for american gold.
we d fire no guns shed no tears.
now i am a broken man on a halifax pier.
the last of barrett s privateers.
