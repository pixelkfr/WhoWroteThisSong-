under the sea there s a colony of bees.
and a man named fred who will shoot you dead.
if you try to steal from his apiary sealed.
with magic spells at the gate to hell.
he will kill you in your sleep.
if you so much as take a single peek.
set sail across the waves.
where we will stop no man can say.
the alcohol stores are running low.
so into the deep blue yonder go.
set sail across the waves.
where we will stop no man can say.
we will end our quest by following the smell.
that leads us to the mead from hell.
he brews his mead with psychotropic weeds.
that will get you high assuming you don t die.
and you probably find that it makes you go blind.
from the alcoholic proof it s through the roof.
we seek the mead from hell.
the endless search for the infernal hydromel.
set sail across the waves.
where we will stop no man can say.
the alcohol stores are running low.
so into the deep blue yonder go.
set sail across the waves.
where we will stop no man can say.
we will end our quest by following the smell.
that leads us to the mead from hell.
we have found the mead from hell.
the infernal hydromel.
the booze is in our grasp.
now it s time to kick your ass.
set sail set sail set sail.
set sail for the mead from hell.
