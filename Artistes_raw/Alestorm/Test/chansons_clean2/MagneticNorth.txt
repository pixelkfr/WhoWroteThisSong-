the snow fell hard on a frozen sea.
as the night swarmed all around.
with no moon to guide our passage north.
this corpse of mine may never be found.
thirty days into this dead mans quest.
in search of riches in a time lost treasure chest.
through oceans never seen through fog as thick as night.
to the northern wastelands onwards we must fight.
far beyond the ice and snow.
our voyage carries on.
for blood and gold we sold our souls.
redemption lies at magnetic north.
set the course for magnetic north.
beyond the snow to magnetic north.
on the quest for magnetic north.
we will die at magnetic north.
sold a lie condemned to die.
empty promise encased in ice.
one by one our time has come.
death awaits before the sun.
the snow fell hard on a frozen sea.
as the sun rose to the sky.
trapped forever in the sea of ice.
this is the place where we will die.
far beyond the ice and snow.
our voyage carries on.
for blood and gold we sold our souls.
redemption lies at magnetic north.
set the course for magnetic north.
beyond the snow to magnetic north.
on the quest for magnetic north.
we will die at magnetic north.
