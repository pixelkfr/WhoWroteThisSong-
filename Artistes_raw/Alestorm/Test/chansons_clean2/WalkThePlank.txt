the time for execution a harrowing display.
for treachery upon the seas has taken place this day.
your final hour has begun.
we have all agreed your end has come.
we will take your sword we will take your gun it s time.
for you to come undone.
be aware what lies beneath.
razor sharp and pointy teeth.
walk the plank.
with your life you will pay the price.
walk the plank.
boots of lead your blood runs red.
walk the plank.
time to die your end is nigh.
walk the plank.
descend into the black and don t come back.
a nameless bay in the mist.
you have no right to exist.
you have got the captain really pissed.
and so it s time you were dismissed.
give the line a little twist.
and wrap the ropes around your wrist.
eyes to fill your soul with dread.
the fury of the hammerhead.
walk the plank.
with your life you will pay the price.
walk the plank.
boots of lead your blood runs red.
walk the plank.
time to die your end is nigh.
walk the plank.
descend into the black and don t come back.
be aware my friend what lies beneath.
razor sharp and full of pointy teeth.
burning eyes to fill your soul right up with dread.
the raging fury of the hammerhead.
