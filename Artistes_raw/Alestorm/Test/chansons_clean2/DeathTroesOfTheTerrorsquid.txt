from the deep there s a terror rising.
a great beast with eyes like crimson fire.
leviathan returns to devour the world.
set a course the time for slaughter.
to the heart of the raging oceans blue.
this time the beast will meet its doom.
eternal doom.
legends spoke of the ancient monster.
from a time beyond the dawn of time.
in a pit of primordial ooze.
many years we have been kept waiting.
but tonight that squid will surely die.
revenge is a dish best served fried.
deep fried.
deathsworn oathbound.
on a quest for vengeful slaughter.
we sail to the halls of doom.
with the black flag raised in the sky.
deathsworn oathbound.
no gods shall be our master.
we sail to the halls of doom.
with the black flag raised in the sky.
with a crash of thunder.
our ship sails cross the waves.
on a course to the frozen arctic seas.
we have defeated vikings.
and ninjas we hath slain.
the terrorsquid won t escape again.
never again.
deathsworn oathbound.
on a quest for vengeful slaughter.
we sail to the halls of doom.
with the black flag raised in the sky.
deathsworn oathbound.
no gods shall be our master.
we sail to the halls of doom.
with the black flag raised in the sky.
poseidon s realm falls silent the beast awakens.
between the bounds of light and death.
rides the serpent uroboros.
supine before the altar of doom.
enter into the cthonic lair.
a raging torrent of smoke and fire.
lightning from across the bow.
hear the death throes of the terrorsquid.
the doom of leviathan draws near.
thunderous volleys from the thirty two pounder gun strike the beast as our vessel moves in for the killing blow.
from the bow of the ship the great harpoon is fired impaling through the monster s cursed eyes.
with a final scream of terror leviathan rears up in defeat and is vanquished for all eternity.
