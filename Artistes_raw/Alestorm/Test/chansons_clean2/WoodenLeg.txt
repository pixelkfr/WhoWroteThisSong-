i have got a leg it s made out of wood.
i bought it in a tavern from a gnarly old dude.
when i got shot to pieces by a cannon ball.
it cut me down to size i used to be quite tall.
a couple of drinks to dull the pain.
i stood up on my leg and began to fight again.
when all of a sudden can you believe.
a cannonball hit me in the other knee.
aggghh you spanish bastards.

now both of my legs are made of wood.
the future s looking grim it doesn t seem good.
so i drink all day and i drink all night.
i get really drunk and get into a fight.
with a samurai guy with ninja skills.
he beats me up til i am nearly killed.
i ask him for mercy do me no harm.
but the bastard chops off both my arms.
aggghh you japanese bastards.
