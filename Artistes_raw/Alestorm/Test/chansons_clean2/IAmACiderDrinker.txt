when the moon shines.
on the cow shed.
and we are rollin in the hay.
all the cows are out there grazing.
and the milk is on its way.
i am a cider drinker.
i drinks it all of the day.
i am a cider drinker.
it soothes all me troubles away.
oh arr oh arr aay.
oh arr oh arr aay.
it s so cozy in the kitchen.
with the smell of rabbit stew.
when the breeze blows cross the farmyard.
you can smell the cow sheds too.
oh i have never smelt nothing like it in all my life.
when those combine wheels stops turning.
and a hard day s work is done.
there s a pub around the corner.
it s the place we have our fun.
arr we will have some fun n all.
i am a cider drinker.
i drinks it all of the day.
i am a cider drinker.
it soothes all me troubles away.
oh arr oh arr aay.
oh arr oh arr aay.
come on get a couple of pints down ere then.
now dear old mabel.
when she s able.
we take a stroll down lover s lane.
and we will sink a pint of scrumpy.
then we will play old nature s game.
ha ha ha.
oo arr.
but we end up in the duck pond.
when the pub is sized to close.
with me breeches full o tadpoles.
and the newts between me toes.
i am a cider drinker.
i drinks it all of the day.
i am a cider drinker.
it soothes all me troubles away.
oh arr oh arr aay.
oh arr oh arr aay.
come on everyone get up ere then.
ha ha.
i am a cider drinker.
i drinks it all of the day.
i am a cider drinker.
it soothes all me troubles away.
oh arr oh arr aay.
oh arr oh arr aay.
oh arr oh arr aay.
oh arr oh arr aay.
let cider be the spice of life.
