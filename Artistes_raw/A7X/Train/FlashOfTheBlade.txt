As a young boy chasing Dragons
with your wooden sword so mighty,
You're St. George or you're David and you always
killed the beast
Times change very quickly
And you had to grow up early
A house in smoking ruins and the bodies at your feet

You'll die as you lived
In a flash of the blade
In corner forgotten away
You lived for the touch
For the feel of the steel
One man, in his Honour.

The smell of resined leather
The sticky iron mask
As you cut and thrust and parried at the
fencing master's call
He taught you all he ever knew
To fear no mortal man
And now you'll reach your vengeance in the
Screams of evil man.

You'll die as you lived
In a flash of the blade
In corner forgotten away
You lived for the touch
For the feel of the steel
One man, in his Honour.

You'll die as you lived
In a flash of the blade
In corner forgotten away
You lived for the touch
For the feel of the steel
One man, in his Honour.
