of your afterlife here so stay you will be back here soon anyway.
i see a distant light but girl this can t be right.
such a surreal place to see so how did this come to be.
arrived too early.
and when i think of all the places i just don t belong.
i have come to grips with life and realize this is going too far.
i don t belong here we gotta move on dear escape from this afterlife.
cause this time i am right to move on and on far away from here.
a place of hope and no pain perfect skies with no rain.
can leave this place but refrain cause we have been waiting for you.
fallen into this place just giving you a small taste.
of your afterlife here so stay you will be back here soon anyway.
this peace on earth s not right with my back against the wall.
no pain or sign of time i am much too young to fall.

i have made up my mind.
gave me your hand but realize i just wanna say goodbye.

got nothing against you and surely i will miss you.
this place full of peace and light and i d hoped you might.

before the story begins is it such a sin.
for me to take what s mine until the end of time.
we were more than friends before the story ends.
and i will take what s mine create what god would never design.
our love had been so strong for far too long.
i was weak with fear that something would go wrong.
before the possibilities came true.
i took all possibility from you.
almost laughed myself to tears.

conjuring her deepest fears.

i can t believe it.
ripped his heart out right before his eyes.
eyes over easy eat it eat it eat it.

and you sit there and do nothing.
the air is cold and thin.
you are content with doing nothing.
thoughts are haunting me as i look around.
but in my life i wanted more.
this will never end when i will bleed forever.
this will never end.
don t acknowledge right just dwell on wrong.
this spot in hell s where i belong.
i have come so far it s been so long.
don t know why it started or where it came from.
outside shell is strong confident.
there is nowhere to run and hide.
but slowly eats away.
stuck alone inside your head.
like a man plagued with disease i try to fight.
guess you are better off dead.
through my pores it seems to seep.
your mind bleeding.
when i will bleed forever.
don t acknowledge right just dwell on wrong.
this spot in hell s where i belong.
i have come so far it s been so long.
don t know why it started or where it came from.
and you sit there and do nothing.

the phone would ring in the empty house.
no one s around.
don t acknowledge right just dwell on wrong.
this spot in hell s where i belong.
i have come so far it s been so long.
don t know why it started or where it came from.
but in my life i wanted more.
i needed more i taste more.
shh quiet you might piss somebody off.
like me motherfucker you have been at it for too long.
while you feed off others insecurities.
you stand in front of me and bite the hand that feeds.
self righteousness is wearing thin.
lies inside your head your best friend.
heart bleeds but not for fellow men.
broken glass your fake reflection.
i have had enough.
it s time for something real.
i don t respect the words you are speaking.
gone too far.
a clone.
so how does it feel to know that someone s kid.
in the heart of america has blood on their hands.
fighting to defend your rights.
so you can maintain a lifestyle.
that insults his family s existence.
well where i am from we have a special.
salute that we aim high in the air.
towards all those pompous assholes.
who spend their days pointing fingers.
fuck you.
shh quiet you might piss somebody off.
like the heartbeat of this country when antagonized too long.
i will be damned if you count me in as part of your generous hypocrisy.
collecting enemies.
tabloid gossip queen worthless man.
there s no need for us to bury you.
selfish agenda once again.
right this way you have dug your own grave.
i have had enough.
it s time for something real.
i don t respect the words you are speaking.
gone too far.
a clone.
all the way from the east to the west.
we got this high society.
looking down on their very foundation.
constantly reminding us that our actions.
are the cause of all their problems.
pointing their fingers in every.
direction blaming their.
own nation for who wins the elections.
they have never contributed a fucking thing to the.
country they love to criticize.
excuse the obscene ignore the untrue.
depictions we see try and get through.
admitting mistakes can hurt.
i am not the last but i sure ain t the first.
shh quiet you might piss somebody off.
self righteousness is wearing thin.
lies inside your head your best friend.
heart bleeds but not for fellow men.
broken glass your fake reflection.
i have had enough.
it s time for something real.
i don t respect the words you are speaking.
gone too far.
a clone.
i have been traveling for so long.
so lost till i stumbled upon.
two roads in front of me i had to take my time.
to the right i could see a church.
i took a step in that direction first.
but to the left there was a watering hole.
where they were whiskey drunk.
and now that s where i wanna pray.
the fight down here goes on and on.
if i was perfect then this would be easy.
either road is plausible on both i could drown.
i walk through the center with no rules to guide me.
i realize it s difficult but now i can see.
there s gotta be another way to go.
a way that s much more feasible.
a combination of both these lives.
a central path without choosing a side.
i make decisions one at a time.
and no i never say i am always right.
i am confident that when i stand on my own.
you will see the truest form of a man when i am shining through.
the fight down here goes on and on.
if i was perfect then this would be easy.
either road is plausible on both i could drown.
i walk through the center with no rules to guide me.
i realize it s difficult but now i can see.
oh i hear them now.
all the religious rhyme.
you are a sin you are a sin you are a sinner.
the left isn t better.
it s just more of the same.
condemning all these people for what they believe.
i will climb to the top of their mountain again.
no harness up to save me this way.
and the closer to the top i get.
the more they take aim.
but i am not you.
i may not be perfect but i have always been true.
i may not be worthy in your eyes.
climb up from the bottom for the last time.
the last one the last one the last time.
if i was perfect then this would be easy.
either road is plausible on both i could drown.
i walk through the center with no rules to guide me.
i realize it s difficult but now i can see.
a lonely road crossed another cold state line.
miles away from those i love purpose hard to find.
while i recall all the words you spoke to me.
can t help but wish that i was there.
back where i d love to be oh yeah.
dear god the only thing i ask of you.
is to hold her when i am not around.
when i am much too far away.
we all need that person who can be true to you.
but i left her when i found her.
and now i wish i d stayed.
cause i am lonely and i am tired.
i am missing you again oh no.
once again.
there s nothing here for me on this barren road.
there s no one here while the city sleeps.
and all the shops are closed.
can t help but think of the times i have had with you.
pictures and some memories will have to help me through oh yeah.
dear god the only thing i ask of you.
is to hold her when i am not around.
when i am much too far away.
we all need that person who can be true to you.
i left her when i found her.
and now i wish i d stayed.
cause i am lonely and i am tired.
i am missing you again oh no.
once again.
some search never finding a way.
before long they waste away.
i found you something told me to stay.
i gave in to selfish ways.
and how i miss someone to hold.
when hope begins to fade.
a lonely road crossed another cold state line.
miles away from those i love purpose hard to find.
dear god the only thing i ask of you.
is to hold her when i am not around.
when i am much too far away.
we all need the person who can be true to you.
i left her when i found her.
and now i wish i d stayed.
cause i am lonely and i am tired.
i am missing you again oh no.
once again.
i have been thinking lots about my life and.
how quick i d wash it down the drain.
past tense the future nothing matters now.
i act on my own and i am to blame.
living s a wicked dream where things turn out all wrong.
we are all so weak no matter how strong yeah.

convince me that i have grown but i can t.
change so unnaturally demons they follow me.

crushed daily.
don t lend me your hand.
i can t trust myself.

i tried running away from me.
convince me that i have grown but i can t.

but it s not true i don t need you.
don t waste your time and don t waste mine.
i am not your friend i won t soothe your soul.
and in the end you are all dead to me.
black enchanting eyes.
cut through my heart.
with no regret or sign of life.
they tear apart my pride.
and cold runs through my veins.
i feel their stare from miles.
haunting every step.
and they won t stop hunting me down.
i know the time will come.
when all around me s burned.
and you will still see me there.
asking where you went too.
and what person brought you here.
and why you left the burning children.
cold out in the night.
and calling for you all alone.
dark in their hearts.
i can feel it burn inside of me.
tormented young with no souls haunting me.
pain in their lives all they know is misery.
take these chains away that are holding me down.
holding me down.

and your desperate and villainous ways.
turning their hearts into stone.

centuries passed and still the same.
war in our blood some things never change.
fighting for land and personal gain.

with peace of mind so hard to find.
we are dwelling on the drastic signs.
another way to numb our mind.

and pray for a better life.
you will see it flying helplessly away.
we have all been lost for most of this life.

two nights ago i was shot.
a bullet sunk straight through the skull.
a friend pulled the trigger that silenced me.
no pain as i awoke but dead.
seeing the face of the man.
the time as he lays down his gun.
i knew this was going to take place.
white silence so peaceful so numb.
no one knows the time they are changing.
no one will see through.
you are all gone to me gone to me.
i have been pulled out to watch from my eternal sleep.
intuition and a warning to believe i will believe.
something was wrong and though i felt i had to stay.
moving on seemed to be somber bliss.
without one goodbye.
i watch my mother shed tears.
no.
this gun has stopped time in its tracks.
has altered the course of my fate.
destiny is shattered and timeless.
closed eyes feel the cold winds embrace.
i will watch you call calling for me.
you can t bring back time.
close your eyes or look away.
fate exposed won t let me stay.
hope will fall tonight with broken wings.
descending entity in me.
my voice has been taken from me.
the more i listen the more i have to say.
you are all gone to me gone to me.
i have been pulled out to watch from my eternal sleep.
intuition and a warning to believe i will believe.
something was wrong and though i felt i had to stay.
moving on seemed to be somber bliss.
without one goodbye.
i watch my mother shed tears.
and taste the blood that she cries.
and taste the blood that she cries.
i will watch you call calling for me.
you can t bring back time.
close your eyes or look away.
fate exposed won t let me stay.
hope will fall tonight with broken wings.
descending entity in me.
with this ink in my skin we have sealed our fate.
and the axe comes early.
only naturally so what does that matter.
there s a bed of skeletons waiting for me.
on the other side.
they are waiting for my next move next fatal breath.
human lives to me seem so unreal can t see through the fog.
nothing past a grey wall see past the stereotype.
belief structure built up in you.
i will tear you down and the one who created you.
if they didn t have one how would they act.
if we didn t have hope how would we behave.
would they still feel remorse.
if they slaughtered innocent beings.
or is hope the only thing that keeps you sane.
a good friend once told me you are memory.
without them we equal nothing.
and all i can see is the place i wanna be.
suddenly my life was so free.
leaves at my feet blown to the ground.
their echoes are reaching my ears.
night s coming fast suns going down.
but keep away from me.
keep away from me.
keep away from me.
keep away from me.
keep away from me.
it s hard to keep me in this place keep away from me.
we may have created the beginning mentally.
we may have created the beginning physically.
to the end of our human existence.
i see through you.
the fear that s in your eyes.
a good friend once told me we are memory.
without them we equal nothing.
and all i can see is the place i wanna be.
timeless my life was so free.
leaves at my feet blown to the ground.
their echoes are reaching my ears.
nights coming fast suns going down confused.
i don t know the answers but neither do you.
caught up in this madness too blind to see.
woke animal feelings in me.
took over my sense and i lost control.
i will taste your blood tonight.
you know i make you wanna scream.
you know i make you wanna run from me baby.
but know it s too late you have wasted all your time yeah.
relax while you are closing your eyes to me.
so warm as i am setting you free.
with your arms by your side there s no struggling.
pleasure s all mine this time.
you know i make you wanna scream.
you know i make you wanna run from me baby.
but know it s too late you have wasted all your time.
cherishing those feelings pleasuring.
cover me unwanted clemency.
scream till there s silence.
scream while there s life left vanishing.
scream from the pleasure unmask your desire.
perishing.
we have all had a time where we have lost control.
we have all had our time to grow.
i am hoping i am wrong but i know i am right.
i will hunt again one night.
you know i make you wanna scream.
you know i make you wanna run from me baby.
but know it s too late you have wasted all your time.
cherishing those feelings pleasuring.
cover me unwanted clemency.
scream till there s silence.
scream while there s life left vanishing.
scream from the pleasure unmask your desire.
perishing.
some live repressing their instinctive feelings.
protest the way we are built don t point the blame on me.
scream scream scream the way you would.
if i ravaged your body.
scream scream scream the way you would.
if i ravaged your mind.
cherishing those feelings pleasuring.
cover me unwanted clemency.
scream till there s silence.
scream while there s life left vanishing.
scream from the pleasure unmask your desire.
perishing.
we keep writing talking and planning but everything s changing.
we all know what to do but no one does it.
now this time has passed and full of regret.
two in my heart have left me a while i stand alone.
when they get back it won t be the same.
never be the same.
my life you have always been there.
now you are gone and my head s spinning.
left the childhood left the memories left the good times in the past.
moving on your time has run out.
wishing the clock would stand still the world can wait.
wasting away once again once lived as friends.
as time passes by regrets for the rest of my life.
the ones who i confide were gone in the black of the night.
never will i forget you and all the memories past.
so rarely i get to see your face.
growing i looked to you in guidance.
we knew that time would kill us but you are still so close to me.
to me you were my life.
to me you were my soul companion.
now you are so far away.
nothing can take away the times and the memories we had.
come back to the days when we were young.
come back to the days when nothing mattered.
to the days when nothing mattered.
and i feel time passes by regrets for the rest of my life.
the ones who i confide were gone in the black of the night.
as time passes by regrets for the rest of my life.
the ones who i confide were gone in the black of the night.
somewhere life is good and things go as they should.
it s hard to find but that s alright yeah.
searching for the way push harder everyday.
it s deep inside that shining light yeah.
but i am scarred by barriers placed in my path.
i am scathed.
this ride that takes me through life.
leads me into darkness but emerges into light.
no one can ever slow me down.
i will stay unbound.
sometimes when we are young and always on the run.
it gets so dark and i know that place yeah.
so don t be too concerned you have got a lot to learn.
well so do i and we have got plenty of time yeah.
don t fall off the track yet with so many races to go.
hold on.
this ride that takes me through life.
leads me into darkness but emerges into light.
no one can ever slow me down.
i will stay unbound.
some live so wrong with what we do is each his own.
but living in fear endless shame for countless years.
i never lived in fear i knew i d die another day.
i never viewed my life as something slipping away.
some live so wrong with what we do is each his own.
but living in fear endless shame for countless years.
i never lived in fear i knew i d die another day.
i never viewed my life as something slipping away.
there s nothing here to take for granted.
with each breath that we take.
the hands of time strip youth from our bodies.
and we fade.
memories remain.
as time goes on.
there s nothing here to take for granted.
with each breath that we take.
the hands of time strip youth from our bodies.
and we fade.
memories remain.
as time goes on.
i will try she said as he walked away.
try not to lose you.
two vibrant hearts could change.
nothing tears the being more than deception.
unmasked fear.
i will be here waiting tested and secure.
nothing hurts my world.
just affects the ones around me.
when sin s deep in my blood.
you will be the one to fall.
i wish i could be the one.
the one who won t care at all.
but being the one on the stand.
i know the way to go no one s guiding me.
when time soaked with blood turns its back.
i know it s hard to fall.
confided in me was your heart.
i know it s hurting you but it s killing me.
nothing will last in this life.
our time is spent constructing.
now you are perfecting a world meant to sin.
constrict your hands around me.
squeeze till i cannot breathe.
this air tastes dead inside me.
contribute to our plague.
break all your promises.
tear down this steadfast wall.
restraints are useless here.
tasting salvation s near.
nothing hurts my world.
just affects the ones around me.
when sin s deep in my blood.
you will be the one to fall.
i wish i could be the one.
the one who won t care at all.
but being the one on the stand.
i know the way to go no one s guiding me.
when time soaked with blood turns its back.
i know it s hard to fall.
confided in me was your heart.
i know it s hurting you but it s killing me.
wake the ones and rise tonight.
fallen souls we shine so bright.
rise now and ever.
leave your memory.
rise now and ever.
leave your memory.
no one can touch us.
