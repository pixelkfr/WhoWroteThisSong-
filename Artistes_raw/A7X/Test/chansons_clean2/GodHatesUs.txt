total nightmare.
total nightmare.
you wanna hear my side.
you need to drown to know.
with all the times it hurt me to fuck you.
i built a wall with your blood to show.
god save us.
god save us all.
god hates us.
god hates us all.
total nightmare.
total nightmare.
nothing to heal.
no one to break.
pills had a role now there s nothing to take.
nothing to trust.
no one to fake.
you will find out sooner that it s best if we just know our place.
lies.
my infiltrated mind.
my lacerated soul.
it took me years create me control you.
i left myself for an idea i stole.
god save us.
god save us all.
god hates us.
god hates us all.
total nightmare.
total nightmare.
roar.
rape.
kill.
love.
hate.
fear.
you better take your time.
roar.
rape.
kill.
you better take it slow.
cause when you seek the one.
love.
hate.
fear.
there s nothing left to show.
total nightmare.
total nightmare.
total nightmare.
total nightmare.
