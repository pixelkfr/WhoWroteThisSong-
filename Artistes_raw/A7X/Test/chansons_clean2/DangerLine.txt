my sixteen locked and loaded.
all fear has been avoided.
you say the words and my weapon is drawn.
this one could be my last time.
some people call it war crime.
i may be staring down a lethal sight.
to die.
nothing shocks you like a bullet hole.
leaving my fear on the danger line.
suffering no man should never know.
leaving my faith on the danger line.
i do this for my family.
my daughter loves her daddy.
too many talk down on things they don t know.
with colors never faded.
reckless and unabated.
they may take me but never take us all.
i will crawl.
nothing shocks you like a bullet hole.
leaving my fear on the danger line.
suffering no man should never know.
leaving my faith on the danger line.
i know what you are thinking.
i have been there before.
so think of the times.
the time we spent laughing away.
so think of the times.
at home.
life without a care.
now i find myself in my own blood.
never thought i d lie in my own blood.
the damage done is far beyond repair.
i never put my faith in up above.
never had much faith in up above.
but now i am hoping someone s there.
i never meant to leave this world alone.
i never meant to hurt the ones who cared.
and all this time i thought we d just grow old.
you know no one said it s fair.
tell my baby girl that it s alright.
i have sung my last song today.
remind the lord to leave his light on.
for me.
i am free.
