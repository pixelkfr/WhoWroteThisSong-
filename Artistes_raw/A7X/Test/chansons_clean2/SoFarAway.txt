never feared for anything.
never shamed but never free.
a life to heal the broken heart with all that it could.
lived a life so endlessly.
saw beyond what others see.
i tried to heal your broken heart with all that i could.
will you stay.
will you stay away forever.
how do i live without the ones i love.
time still turns the pages of the book it s burned.
place and time always on my mind.
i have so much to say but you are so far away.
plans of what our futures hold.
foolish lies of growing old.
it seems we are so invincible.
the truth is so cold.
a final song a last request.
a perfect chapter laid to rest.
now and then i try to find.
a place in my mind.
where you can stay.
you can stay away forever.
how do i live without the ones i love.
time still turns the pages of the book it s burned.
place and time always on my mind.
i have so much to say but you are so far away.
sleep tight i am not afraid not afraid.
the ones that we love are here with me.
lay away a place for me place for me.
cause as soon as i am done i will be on my way.
to live eternally.
how do i live without the ones i love.
time still turns the pages of the book it s burned.
place and time always on my mind.
and the light you left remains but it s so hard to stay.
when i have so much to say and you are so far away.
i love you you were ready.
the pain is strong and urges rise.
but i will see you when he lets me.
your pain is gone your hands untied.
so far away so far.
and i need you to know.
so far away so far.
and i need you to need you to know.
