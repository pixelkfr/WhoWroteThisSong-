dead men they celebrate.
as the final chapter fades away.
cause they can t hide.
we can see their flesh is rotten.
the band plays a hopeful tune.
the champagne is poured as they socialize.
the look in their eyes.
hide in the light.
everything is paid for tonight.
while at the party of the dead dancing in their graves.
the drinks here are free.
so relax.
enjoy the sight of all the dead dancing in their graves.
and while the world that they built.
told em to change.
told em to listen.
they just kept it the same.
and now that midnight has come.
i am in a room watching the dead dancing in their graves.
bones covered up by suits.
as the visible scars they multiply.
kiss it good bye.
too stubborn and now you are destroyed.
tick tock.
the time bomb has been recognized been pressurized.
nowhere to hide.
swallowing light.
everything is paid for tonight.
while at the party of the dead dancing in their graves.
the drinks here are free.
so relax.
enjoy the sight of all the dead dancing in their graves.
and while the world that they built.
told em to change.
told em to listen.
they just kept it the same.
and now that midnight has come.
i am in a room watching the dead dancing in their graves.
we feel a coming strain.
and now it s too late.
to change.
what you want is law.
you crowd me with all that you stole.
oh how the mighty fall.
yeah yeah yeah.
everything is paid for tonight.
while at the party of the dead dancing in their graves.
the drinks here are free.
so relax.
