i wake up every morning bright and early.
roll out of bed but i am never quite alone.
tension is pulling me in all directions.
and all of these problems use me as their own.
sometimes the pressure will just drive you crazy.
at any time i could explode.
i need some piece of mind it s got me tired.
don t wanna lose it but i am turning down that road.
i need a moment cause i have spread myself to thin.
we all need a moment in our life.
works hard the days too long.
and that s just where it begins.
tension has had us all this time.
i sit in traffic every single morning.
just as i arrive i am slaving to the grind.
making the money so i feed my family.
but i can t raise them cause i ain t got the time.
i got no free days on my busy schedule.
i turn the page and it s the same.
don t like my situation you don t either.
don t wanna look back scared i am working life away.
i need a moment cause i have spread myself to thin.
we all need a moment in our life.
works hard the days too long.
and that s just where it begins.
tension has had us all this time.
but every now and then.
i drive alone.
an open road.
hot summer day.
a gentle breeze that feels alright.
all alone.
and i can t feel no pain.
only strength.
enjoy the sights.
i feel alive.
relaxing here just feels alright.
far from home.
i need a moment cause i have spread myself to thin.
we all need a moment in our life.
works hard the days too long.
and that s just where it begins.
tension has had us all this time.
