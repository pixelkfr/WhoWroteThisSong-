the problem with society s been how do we teach.
and if they will believe.
we will fight this battle for years to come.
til we all accept that we can stand on our own.
grandfather used his hands he worked them to the bone.
provide his family with a happy home alone.
don t take your aggression out on me.
my own man is all i am meant to be.
this common place is so lazy old and tired.
all your ideas are so fucking uninspired.
takes more than one idea.
more than one person to fight the fight.
how many times have you taught and not conspired.
you don t wanna be they never say.
but don t call us the liars.
we have walked these alleys a thousand times.
and scattered around a thousand lies.
they are trying to hold you down.
your life may be hard.
but keep your feet on the ground.
why don t i have the finer things that others have.
the chance is there if you want it all that bad.
so bad.
don t take your aggression out on me.
my own man is all i am meant to be.
this common place is so lazy old and tired.
all your ideas are so fucking uninspired.
takes more than one idea.
more than one person to fight the fight.
how many times have you taught and not conspired.
don t try and get me confused.
cause i do understand.
and sometimes people need help.
that they may need a hand.
when this problems going on.
a thing you have to get straight.
is that you don t own my hand.
and i don t owe you a thing.
so don t think about how sorry you feel.
and now you are treated so bad.
this common place is so lazy old and tired.
all your ideas are so fucking uninspired.
takes more than one idea.
more than one person to fight the fight.
how many times have you taught and not conspired.
and as we race we look back and we have come so far.
while some may conquer the others had it so hard.
but in this day we just complain while there s no one for us to fight.
i guess we are bored and it s how we keep us occupied.
