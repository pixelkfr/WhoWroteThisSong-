now i think i understand.
how this world can overcome a man.
like a friend we saw it through.
in the end i gave my life for you.
gave you all i had to give.
found a place for me to rest my head.
while i may be hard to find.
heard there s peace just on the other side.
not that i could.
or that i would.
let it burn.
under my skin.
let it burn.
left this life to set me free.
took a piece of you inside of me.
all this hurt can finally fade.
promise me you will never feel afraid.
not that i could.
or that i would.
let it burn.
under my skin.
let it burn.
i hope it s worth it.
here on the highway yeah.
i know you will find your own way.
when i am not with you.
so tell everybody.
the ones who walk beside me yeah.
i hope you will find your own way.
when i am not with you tonight.
i hope it s worth it.
what s left behind me yeah.
i know you will find your own way.
when i am not with you.
so tell everybody.
the ones who walk beside me yeah.
i know you will find your own way.
when i am not with you tonight.
