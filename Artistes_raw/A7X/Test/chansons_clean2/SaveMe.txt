skull.
aaaah.
they all know.
they all know.
sorry did i wake your dreams.
some questions run too deep.
we only only wake up when we sleep.
led by the lunar light trouble s all we d find.
lost our way tonight.
is it something we said.
is it something we said to them.
is it something we said.
save me.
i am trapped in a vile world.
where the endings are the same as every other.
we are only here to die.
save me.
i am losing my only dream.
i can use some guiding light some place to go.
if you hear me let me know.
they all know.
they all know.
ever since the day you left my fate s been set unknown.
how many years to walk this path alone.
so much to see tonight so why d you close your eyes.
why can t i shut mine.
is it something we did.
is it something we did to them.
is it something we did.
save me.
i am trapped in a vile world.
where the endings are the same as every other.
we are only here to die.
save me.
i am losing my only dream.
i can use some guiding light some place to go.
if you hear me let me know if you hear me let me know.
aaaah.
help me find my way.
i said help me find my way.
no pulse inside of me.
stone cold lips and heresy.
all lies into a degree.
losing who i wanna be.
you will find out right now.
he may be out of his mind but some day you will find.
that sanity s left us all blind and dragged us all behind.
a moment seen through those eyes crystal blue disguise.
they say that all beauty must die i say it just moves on.
if you d only open your mind then someday you will find.
insanity left us behind and walked right through the door.
i can see the pictures clear as yesterday pictures all my own.
i can hear the voices begging you to stay but know you are not alone.
save me.
i am trapped in a vile world.
where the endings are the same as every other.
we are only here to die.
save me.
i am losing my only dream.
i can use some guiding light some place to go.
if you hear me let me know if you hear me let me know.
tonight we all die young.
tonight we all die young.
tonight we all die young.
tonight we all die young.
tonight we all die young.
tonight we all die young.
tonight we all die.
tonight we all die young.
