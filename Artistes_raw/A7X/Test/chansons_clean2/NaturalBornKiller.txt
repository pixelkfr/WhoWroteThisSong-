one snap for the dying.
one click to end the day.
another story with a mangled scene.
it couldn t happen any other way.
you wanna talk about it.
i am begging you to walk in my shoes any time.
watch the clock till you unwind.
you wanna cry about it.
it s making me consider that i have lost my mind.
the way i see you must be blind.
so this is the world you left behind.
this is the guilt that consumes you.
so die alone.
this is the one thing that i won t do.
so say your prayers.
cause i ain t leaving here without you.
can t bribe me with money.
can t shower me with shame.
another killer from a broken home.
until you cover me with manic fame.
you wanna know about it.
but i am a be fucking with you every time.
story broken you are behind.
and when you ask about it.
you can rest assured i will give you my best side.
seems we all have friends to find.
so this is the hate i have been born to.
full are the tales of the untrue.
so die alone.
this is the one thing that i won t do.
so say your prayers.
cause i ain t leaving here without you.
and i am waiting.
waiting for the days to slowly pass me by.
and all the promises i will find.
no hesitating you pull the trigger now your story s left behind.
i know you want to see me fry.
like my soul you won t survive.
so die alone.
this is the one thing that i won t do.
so say your prayers.
cause i ain t leaving here without you.
to die unknown.
would crush the fish lens we all see through.
to kill the glare.
expose the ugliness we hold true.
