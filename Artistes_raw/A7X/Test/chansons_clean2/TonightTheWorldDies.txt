lost the meaning of our stay.
learn to live another day.
doubt the choices that we have made.
i know that we can t hide our shame.
it s only in disguise.
drowning in our own debris.
fool our thoughts as though we are free.
close our eyes so we can see.
the depth of all we mean to be.
if only in my eyes.
i don t mind.
read the writing on the wall.
mother cries.
tortured voices as we crawl.
find me on my better days.
to lose it once again.
in a way.
so try and love me while you can.
and take the time to understand.
as long as i can touch your face.
you know i will never leave this place.
if only in my mind.
i don t mind.
read the writing on the wall.
mother cries.
tortured voices as we crawl.
find me on my better days.
to lose it once again.
but i seem to find no better ways.
to consciously pretend.
silence all i want to say.
with tendencies to run away.
i will run away.
with you tonight.
launder all my sins away.
and just like that mistakes are made.
you know.
tonight the world dies.
i don t mind.
read the writing on the wall.
mother cries.
tortured voices as we crawl.
find me on my better days.
to lose it once again.
but i seem to find no better ways.
to consciously pretend.
