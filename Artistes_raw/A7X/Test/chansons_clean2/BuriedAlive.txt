take the time just to listen.
when the voices screaming are much too loud.
take a look in the distance.
try and see it all.
chances are that ya might find.
that we share a common discomfort now.
i feel i am walking a fine line.
tell me only if it s real.
still i am on my way.
on and on it goes.
vacant hope to take.
hey i can t live in here for another day.
darkness has kept the light concealed.
grim as ever.
hold on to faith as i dig another grave.
meanwhile the mice endure the wheel.
real as ever.
and it seems i have been buried alive.
i walk the fields through the fire.
taking steps until i found solid ground.
followed dreams reaching higher.
couldn t survive the fall.
much has changed since the last time.
and i feel a little less certain now.
you know i jumped at the first sign.
tell me only if it s real.
memories seem to fade.
on and on it goes.
wash my view away.
hey i can t live in here for another day.
darkness has kept the light concealed.
grim as ever.
hold on to faith as i dig another grave.
meanwhile the mice endure the wheel.
real as ever.
and i am chained like a slave trapped in the dark.
slammed all the locks death calls my name.
and it seems i have been buried alive.
take you down now burn it all out.
throw you all around get your fuckin.
hands off me.
what s it feel like took the wrong route.
watch it fall apart now you are knockin at the wrong gate.
for you to pay the toll a price for you alone.
the only deal you will find i will gladly take your soul.
while it seems sick sober up quick.
psycho lunatic crushing you with.
hands of fate.
shame to find out when it s too late.
but you are all the same.
trapped inside inferno awaits.
evil thoughts can hide i will help release the mind.
i will peel away the skin release the dark within.
this is now your life.
strike you from the light.
this is now your life.
die buried alive.
this is now your life what s it feel like.
strike you from the light let me take in your soul.
this is now your life what s it feel like.
die buried alive let me take in your soul.
this is now your life.
die buried alive.
