can t you see i am easily bothered by persistence.
one step from lashing out at you.
you want in to get under my skin.
and call yourself a friend.
i have got more friends like you.
what do i do.
is there no standard anymore.
what it takes who i am where i have been belong.
you can t be something you are not.
be yourself by yourself.
stay away from me.
a lesson learned in life.
known from the dawn of time.
respect walk.
what did you say.
respect walk.
are you talking to me.
are you talking to me.
run your mouth when i am not around.
it s easy to achieve.
you cry to weak friends that sympathize.
can you hear the violins playing your song.
those same friends tell me your every word.
is there no standard anymore.
what it takes who i am where i have been belong.
you can t be something you are not.
be yourself by yourself.
stay away from me.
a lesson learned in life.
known from the dawn of time.
respect walk.
what did you say.
respect walk.
are you talking to me.
respect walk.
what did you say.
respect walk.
are you talking to me.

what did you say.

are you talking to me.
