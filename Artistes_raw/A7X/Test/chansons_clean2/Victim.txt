house full of roses.
a letter on the stairs.
a tape full of messages.
for anyone who cares.
collage of broken words.
and stories full of tears.
remembering your life.
cause we wish you were here.
nothing is harder.
than to wake up all alone.
realize it s not okay.
it s the end of all you know.
time keeps passing by.
but it seems i am frozen still.
scars are left behind.
but some too deep to feel.
and some say this can t be real.
and i have lost my power to feel tonight.
we are all just victims of a crime.
when all s gone and can t be regained.
we can t seem to shelter the pain inside.
we are all just victims of a crime.
some days you will find me.
in the place i like to go.
ask questions to myself.
bout the things i will never know.
what s left to find.
cause i need a little more.
i need a little time.
can we even up the score.
and some say this can t be real.
and i have lost my power to feel tonight.
we are all just victims of a crime.
when all s gone and can t be regained.
we can t seem to shelter the pain inside.
we are all just victims of a crime.
nothing lasts forever.
for all good things it s true.
i d rather trade it all.
while somehow saving you.
it must have been the season.
that threw us out of line.
once i stood so tall.
now i am searching for a sign.
so don t need your salvation.
with promises unkind.
and all those speculation.
save it for another time.
cause we all need a reason.
a reason just to stay.
some just can t be bothered.
to stick around another day.
and some say this can t be real.
and i have lost my power to feel tonight.
we have all been victims of a crime.
when all is gone and can t be regained.
we can t seem to shelter the pain inside oh.
we have all been victims of a crime.
victims of a crime.
living with this crime.
i am missing you.
i am missing you.
i am missing you.
i am missing you.
