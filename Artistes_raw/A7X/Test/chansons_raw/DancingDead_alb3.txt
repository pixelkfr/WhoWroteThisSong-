Dead men, they celebrate
As the final chapter fades away
'Cause they can't hide;
We can see their flesh is rotten!

The band plays a hopeful tune
The champagne is poured as they socialize
The look in their eyes
Hide in the light

Everything is paid for tonight
While at the party of the dead dancing in their graves
The drinks here are free
So relax
Enjoy the sight of all the dead dancing in their graves
And while the world that they built
Told 'em to change
Told 'em to listen
They just kept it the same
And now that midnight has come,
I'm in a room watching the dead dancing in their graves

Bones covered up by suits
As the visible scars, they multiply
Kiss it good-bye
Too stubborn and now you're destroyed!

Tick, tock
The time bomb has been recognized, been pressurized
Nowhere to hide
Swallowing light

Everything is paid for tonight
While at the party of the dead dancing in their graves
The drinks here are free
So relax
Enjoy the sight of all the dead dancing in their graves
And while the world that they built
Told 'em to change
Told 'em to listen
They just kept it the same
And now that midnight has come,
I'm in a room watching the dead dancing in their graves

We feel a coming strain
And now it's too late
To change

What you want is law
You crowd me with all that you stole
Oh, how the mighty fall
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Everything is paid for tonight
While at the party of the dead dancing in their graves
The drinks here are free
So relax
Enjoy the sight of all the dead dancing in their graves
And while the world that they built
Told 'em to change
Told 'em to listen
They just kept it the same
And now that midnight has come,
I'm in a room watching the dead dancing in their graves

We feel a coming strain
And now it's too late
To change
We feel a coming strain
And now it's too late
To change
We feel a coming strain
And now it's too late
To change
