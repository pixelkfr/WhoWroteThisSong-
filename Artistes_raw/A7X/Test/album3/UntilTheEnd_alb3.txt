Weekends on young and angry streets
We meet, drink 'till trouble found us there
Living life as without a care
We've had our fights, been black and blue
It's true, I've even gone to jail for you my friends
Bet your life that I'd do it again

(Until the End)

Don't change the way you think of me
We're from the same story
Life moves on, can't stay the same
For some of us, I'm worried, yeah

While some have gone their separate ways
There's some still caught up with the past
And stead to move on, you're missing most of your life
They say it's hard to stay the same
When some fail, while other men seem to gain, but friends
I'll be with you here until the end

(Until the End)

Don't change the way you think of me
We're from the same story
Life moves on, can't stay the same
For some of us, I'm worried

We're all falling forward
With no signs of slow
Some moving faster
That's all that I wanted
I wanted

I know it's hard
It's passing by
Memories
Be out all night
So reminisce won't bring you back
Just look ahead and hold on tight

We're all falling forward
With no signs of slow
Some moving faster
That's all that I wanted
I wanted

Don't change the way you think of me
Oh yeah

Until the end
Until the end
Until the end
Until the end
