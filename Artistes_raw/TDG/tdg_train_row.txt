I can't escape this hell
So many times i've tried
But i'm still caged inside
Somebody get me through this nightmare
I can't control myself

So what if you can see the darkest side of me?
No one will ever change this animal I have become
Help me believe it's not the real me
Somebody help me tame this animal
(This animal, this animal)

I can't escape myself
(I can't escape myself)
So many times i've lied
(So many times i've lied)
But there's still rage inside
Somebody get me through this nightmare
I can't control myself

So what if you can see the darkest side of me?
No one will ever change this animal I have become
Help me believe it's not the real me
Somebody help me tame this animal I have become
Help me believe it's not the real me
Somebody help me tame this animal

Somebody help me through this nightmare
I can't control myself
Somebody wake me from this nightmare
I can't escape this hell

(This animal, this animal, this animal, this animal, this animal, this animal, this animal)

So what if you can see the darkest side of me?
No one will ever change this animal I have become
Help me believe it's not the real me
Somebody help me tame this animal I have become
Help me believe it's not the real me

Just let me say one thing
I've had enough
You're selfish and sorry
You'll never learn
How to love
As your world disassembles
Better keep your head up

Your name,
Your face is
All you have left now
Betrayed, disgraced
You've been erased

So long, so long
I have erased you
So long, so long
I've wanted to waste you
So long, so long
I have erased you
I have escaped
The bitter taste of you

Just let me clear my head
I think I've had too much
You're so disappointing
But you make good use of it

As your world disassembles
Better keep your head up

Your name,
Your face is
All you have left now
Betrayed, disgraced
You've been erased

So long, so long
I have erased you
So long, so long
I've wanted to waste you
So long, so long
I have erased you
I have escaped
The bitter taste of you

Your name,
Your face is
All you have left now
Disgraced, betrayed
You've been erased

So long, so long
I have erased you
So long, so long
I've wanted to waste you
So long, so long
I have erased you
I have escaped
The bitter taste ...
I have escaped
The bitter taste of you 
It’s not what I took from you
It’s not what I stole
We are born like this
Like this

The time has come to change this
To stretch the thought a mile
We’ve lost that kind of spirit

We want it back today
The time is right to change this
To make the life we know
They took what we were given
We’ll get it back again

Somewhere someone’s gun, someone’s gun is laughing
It’s not what I gave to you
It’s now what I sold
We are born like this
(Like this)
It’s not what I took from you
It’s not what I stole
We are born like this

You try your best to mock me
You’re always in my way
You’ve lost what you’ve been given
You’ll get it back today

The time is right to change this
To make the life we know
They took what we were given
We want it back again

Somewhere someone’s gun, someone’s gun is laughing
It’s not what I gave to you
It’s now what I sold
We are born like this
It’s not what I took from you
It’s not what I stole
We are born like this

Somewhere you’re floating high
You’re not living
We are

Somewhere someone’s gun, someone’s gun is laughing, laughing
It’s not what I gave to you
It’s now what I sold
We are born like this
(Like this)
It’s not what I gave to you
It’s not what I stole
We are born like this
(Like this)

It’s not what I took from you
It’s not what I stole
We are born like this 
Tonight, my head is spinning
I need something to pick me up
I’ve tried but nothing is working
I won’t stop
I won’t say I’ve had enough
Tonight, I start the fire
Tonight, I break away

Break away from everybody
Break away from everything
If you can’t stand the way
This place is
Take yourself to higher places

(ohhh, ohhh)

At night I feel like a vampire
It’s not right
I just can’t give it up
I’ll try to get myself higher
Let’s go
We’re going to light it up
Tonight we start the fire
Tonight we break away

Break away from everybody
Break away from everything
If you can’t stand the way
This place is
Take yourself to higher places

If you can’t stand the way this place is
Take (take) yourself (yourself)
To higher places

Break away from everybody
Break away from everything
If you can’t stand the way
This place is
Take yourself to higher places

(ohh…higher places)
(ohh…to higher places)
(ohh…higher places)
Take yourself to higher places 
I'll tell you now you can't win this
You're way too slow
I'll tell you now I'm gonna take this
Did you come here to watch me, watch me burn?

I'll let it show that I'm not always hiding
Come all the way down
And watch me burn
I won't let it show that I'm not always flying
So on the way down
I'll watch you burn

So let me know just how to take this
You're way to cold
Now show me how before it breaks me
Did you come here to watch me, watch me burn?

I'll let it show that I'm not always hiding
Come all the way down
And watch me burn
I won't let it show that I'm not always flying
So on the way down
I'll watch you burn

No, oh

I'll let it show that I'm not always hiding
Come all the way down
And watch me burn
I won't let it show that I'm not always flying
So on the way down
I'll watch you burn
Good morning day
Sorry I’m not there
But all my favourite friends
Vanished in the air
It’s hard to fly when you can’t even run
Once I had the world, but now I’ve got no one

If I needed someone to control me
If I needed someone to hold me down
I would change my direction
And save myself before I
If I needed someone to control me
If I needed someone to push me around
I would change my direction
And save myself before I drown….drown

Good morning day
Sorry you’re not here
All those times before
We’re never this unclear
It’s hard to walk when you can’t even crawl
Once I had this world, but now I’ve lost it all

If I needed someone to control me
If I needed someone to hold me down
I would change my direction
And save myself before I
If I needed someone to control me
If I needed someone to push me around
I would change my direction
And save myself before I drown

Rolling faster than I’m breathing
Drown
Rolling faster than I’m breathing
Drown
Rolling faster than I’m breathing

If I needed someone to control me
If I needed someone to hold me down
I would change my direction
And save myself before I
If I needed someone to control me
If I needed someone to push me around
I would change my direction
And save myself before I
(Save myself before I drown, save myself before I drown, save myself before I drown)
No time for goodbye he said
As he faded away
Don't put your life in someone's hands
They're bound to steal it away
Don't hide your mistakes
'Cause they'll find you, burn you
Then he said

If you want to get out alive
Whoa-oh, run for your life
If you want to get out alive
Whoa-oh, run for your life

This is my last time she said
As she faded away
It's hard to imagine
But one day you'll end up like me
Then she said

If you want to get out alive
Whoa-oh, run for your life
If you want to get out alive
Whoa-oh, run for your life
If you want to get out alive (If you want to get out alive)
Whoa-oh, run for your life (Life)
If you want to get out alive (If you want to get out alive)
Whoa-oh, run for your life

If I stay it won't be long
'Til I'm burning on the inside
If I go I can only hope
That I make it to the other side
If you want to get out alive
Whoa-oh, run for your life
If you want to get out alive
Whoa-oh, run for.....

If you want to get out alive (If you want to get out alive)
Whoa-oh, run for your life
If you want to get out alive (If you want to get out alive)
Whoa-oh, run for...

If I stay, it won't be long
'Til I'm burning on the inside
If I go I can only hope
That I make it to the other side
If I stay, it won't be long
'Til I'm burning on the inside
If I go, and if I go

Burning on the inside
Burning on the inside
Burning on the inside 
Don't know what's going on
Don't know what went wrong
Feels like a hundred years I
Still can't believe you're gone
So I'll stay up all night
With these bloodshot eyes
While these walls surround me with the story of our life

I feel so much better
Now that you're gone forever
I tell myself that I don't miss you at all
I'm not lying, denying that I feel so much better now
That you're gone forever

Now things are coming clear
And I don't need you here
And in this world around me
I'm glad you disappeared
So I'll stay out all night
Get drunk and fuckin' fight
Until the morning comes I'll
Forget about our life

I feel so much better
Now that you're gone forever
I tell myself that I don't miss you at all
I'm not lying, denying that I feel so much better now
That you're gone forever

First time you screamed at me
I should have made you leave
I should have known it could be so much better
I hope you're missing me
I hope I've made you see
That I'm gone forever

And now it's coming clear
That I don't need you here
And in this world around me
I'm glad you disappeared

I feel so much better
Now that you're gone forever
I tell myself that I don't miss you at all
I'm not lying, denying that I feel so much better now
That you're gone forever
And now you're gone forever
And now you're gone forever 
I’ll be coming home
Just to be alone
Cause I know you’re not there
And I know that you don’t care
I can hardly wait to leave this place

No matter how hard I try
You’re never satisfied
This is not a home
I think I’m better off alone
You always disappear
Even when you’re here
This is not my home
I think I’m better off alone
Home, home, this house is not a
Home, home, this house is not a home

By the time you come home
I’m already stoned
You turn off the TV
And you scream at me
I can hardly wait
Till you get off my case

No matter how hard I try
You’re never satisfied
This is not a home
I think I’m better off alone
You always disappear
Even when you’re here
This is not my home
I think I’m better off alone
Home, home, this house is not a
Home, home, this house is not a

Home, home, this house is not a
Home, home, this house is not a home

I’m better off alone

No matter how hard I try
You’re never satisfied
This is not a home
I think I’m better off alone
You always disappear
Even when you’re here
This is not my home
I think I’m better off alone
Home, home, this house is not a
Home, home, this house is not a

Home, home, this house is not a
Home, home, this house is not a home 
Every time we lie awake
After every hit we take
Every feeling that I get
But I haven't missed you yet

Every roommate kept awake
By every sigh and scream we make
All the feelings that I get
But I still don't miss you yet

Only when I stop to think about it

I hate everything about you
Why do I love you?
I hate everything about you
Why do I love you?

Every time we lie awake
After every hit we take
Every feeling that I get
But I haven't missed you yet

Only when I stop to think about it

I hate everything about you
Why do I love you?
I hate everything about you
Why do I love you?

Only when I stop to think about you,
I know
Only when you stop to think about me,
do you know?

I hate everything about you
Why do I love you?
You hate everything about me
Why do you love me?

I hate
You hate
I hate
You love me

I hate everything about you
Why do I love you?

Your bottles' almost empty
You know this can't go on
Because of you my mind is always racing
The needles' breaking your skin
The scar is sinking in
And now your trip begins but
It's all over for
It's all over for

You
For you
When you're on the edge and falling off
It's all over for you
For you
When you're on the edge and falling off
It's all over

I know what runs through your blood
You do this all in vain
Because of you my mind is always racing
And it gets under my skin
To see you giving in
And now your trip begins but
It's all over for
It's all over for

You
For you
When you're on the edge and falling off
It's all over for you
For you
When you're on the edge and falling off
It's all over

And now you're dead inside
Still you wonder why
It's all over
And now you're dead inside
Still you wonder why
It's all over

And now you're dead inside
Still you wonder why
When you're on the edge and falling off
It's all over for (You, for you)
And now you're dead inside
Still you wonder why
When you're on the edge and falling off
It's all over for (You, for you)
And now you're dead inside
Still you wonder why
It's all over

I could be mean
I could be angry
You know I could be just like you

I could be fake
I could be stupid
You know I could be just like you

You thought you were standing beside me
You were only in my way
You're wrong if you think that I'll be just like you

You thought you were there to guide me
You were only in my way
You're wrong if you think that I'll be just like you
You thought you were there to guide me
You were only in my way
You're wrong if you think that I'll be just like you

I could be cold
I could be ruthless
You know I could be just like you

I could be weak
I could be senseless
You know I could be just like you

You thought you were standing beside me
You were only in my way
You're wrong if you think that I'll be just like you

You thought you were there to guide me
You were only in my way
You're wrong if you think that I'll be just like you
You thought you were there to guide me
You were only in my way
You're wrong if you think that I'll be just like you

On my own, cause I can't take living with you
I'm alone, so I won't turn out like you
Want me to

You thought you were standing beside me
You were only in my way
You're wrong if you think that I'll be just like you

You thought you were there to guide me
You were only in my way
You're wrong if you think that I'll be just like you
You thought you were there to guide me
You were only in my way
You're wrong if you think that I'll be just like you

I could be mean
I could be angry
You know I could be just like you 
We had fire in our eyes
In the beginning I
Never felt so alive
In the beginning you
You blame me but
It's not fair when you say that I didn't try
I just don't want to hear it anymore

I swear I never meant to let it die
I just don't care about you anymore
It's not fair when you say that I didn't try
I just don't care about you anymore

We had time on our side
In the beginning we
We had nothing to hide
In the beginning you
You blame me but
It's not fair when you say that I didn't try
I just don't want to hear it anymore

I swear I never meant to let it die
I just don't care about you anymore
It's not fair when you say that I didn't try
I just don't care about you anymore

You say that I didn't try
You say that I didn't try
You say that I didn't try

I swear I never meant to let it die
I just don't care about you anymore
It's not fair when you say that I didn't try
I just don't care about you anymore
I just don't care about you anymore
I just don't care about you anymore
I just don't care about you anymore
I just don't care about you anymore 
Trust me
There’s no need to fear
Everyone’s here
Waiting for you to finally be one of us

Come down...
You may be full of fear
But you’ll be safe here
When you finally trust me
Finally believe in me

I will let you down
I’ll let you down, I’ll
When you finally trust me
Finally believe in me

Trust me
I’ll be there when you need me
You’ll be safe here
When you finally trust me
Finally believe in me

I will let you down
I’ll let you down, I’ll
When you finally trust me
Finally believe in me

I will let you down
I’ll let you down, I’ll
When you finally trust me
Finally believe in me

Never want to come down
Never want to come down
Never want to come down

(Down, let you down)

I will let you down
I’ll let you down, I’ll
When you finally trust me
Finally believe in me

I will let you down
I’ll let you down, I’ll
When you finally trust me
Finally believe in me 
I always knew that you'd
Come back to get me
And you always knew that
It wouldn't be easy
To go back to the start
To see where it all began
Or end up at the bottom
To watch how it all ends
You tried to lie and say
I was everything
I remember when I said
I'm nothing without you

Somehow I found
A way to get lost in you
Let me inside
Let me get close to you
Change your mind
I'll get lost
If you want me to
Somehow I found
A way to get lost in you

You always thought that
I left myself open
But you didn't know
I was already broken
I told myself that
It wouldn't be so bad
Pulling away you took
Everything that I had
You tried to lie and
Say I was everything
I remember when I said
I'm nothing without you

Somehow I found
A way to get lost in you
Let me inside
Let me get close to you
Change your mind
I'll get lost
If you want me to
Somehow I found
A way to get lost in you

The pain of it all
The rise and the fall
I see it all in you
Now everyday
I find myself sayin'
I want to get lost in you
I'm nothing without you

Somehow I found
A way to get lost in you
Let me inside
Let me get close to you
Change your mind
I'll get lost
If you want me to but
Somehow I found (somehow I found)
A way to get lost in you (a way to get lost in you) 
This world will never be
What I expected
And if I don't belong
Who would have guessed it
I will not leave alone
Everything that I own
To make you feel like it's not too late
It's never too late

Even if I say
It'll be alright
Still I hear you say
You want to end your life
Now and again we try
To just stay alive
Maybe we'll turn it all around
'Cause it's not too late
It's never too late

No one will ever see
This side reflected
And if there's something wrong
Who would have guessed it
And I have left alone
Everything that I own
To make you feel like
It's not too late
It's never too late

Even if I say
It'll be alright
Still I hear you say
You want to end your life
Now and again we try
To just stay alive
Maybe we'll turn it all around
'Cause it's not too late
It's never too late

The world we knew
Won't come back
The time we've lost
Can't get back
The life we had
Won't be ours again

This world will never be
What I expected
And if I don't belong

Even if I say
It'll be alright
Still I hear you say
You want to end your life
Now and again we try
To just stay alive
Maybe we'll turn it all around
'Cause it's not too late
It's never too late
Maybe we'll turn it all around
'Cause it's not too late
It's never too late (It's never too late)
It's not too late
It's never too late 
Give me a reason
To stay here
Cause I
Don't want
To live in fear
I can't stop
The rain
But I can stop
The tears
I can fight
The fire
But I can't fight
The fear

No more
I just can't
Live here
No more
I can't take it
Can't take it
No more
What do we
Stand for
When we all
Live in fear?

Give me a reason
To believe
Cause you don't
Wanna see me leave
I can't stop
The rain
But I can stop
The tears
Oh, I can fight
The fire
But I can't fight
The fear

No more
I just can't
Live here
No more
I can't take it
Can't take it
No more
What do we
Stand for
When we all
Live in fear?

No more
I just can't
Live here
No more
I can't take it
Can't take it
No more
What do we
Stand for
When we all
Live in fear? 
In this time are we loving
Or do we sit here wondering
Why this world isn’t turning round
It’s now or never

We have no use
For the truth
And now’s the time for us to lose
Who we are and how we’ve tried
Taking every step in stride
It now or never to decide

In this time are we loving
Or do we sit here wondering
Why this world isn’t turning round
It’s now or never

In this way are we learning
Or do we sit here yearning
For this world to stop turning round
It’s now or never

Where’s the truth
For us to use
Cause all we seem to do is lose
Who we are and how we’ve tried
Are we all the same inside
It’s now or never to decide

In this time are we loving
Or do we sit here wondering
Why this world isn’t turning round
It’s now or never

In this way are we learning
Or do we sit here yearning
For this world to stop turning round
It’s now or never

In this time are we loving
Or do we sit here wondering
Why this world isn’t turning round
It’s now or never

In this time are we loving
Or do we sit here wondering
Why this world isn’t turning round
It’s now or never

In this way are we learning
Or do we sit here yearning
For this world to stop turning round
It’s now or never

In this time are we loving,
Wondering
Isn’t turning round
It’s now or never 
Do you think about
Everything you've been through
You never thought you'd be so depressed
Are you wondering
Is it life or death
Do you think that there's no one like you

We are
We are
We are
We are the ones
We get knocked down
We get back up and stand above the crowd
We are one
We are the ones
We get knocked down
We get back up and stand above the crowd
We are one

The life I think about
Is so much better than this
I never thought I'd be stuck in this mess
I'm sick of wondering
Is it life or death
I need to figure out who's behind me

We are
We are
We are
We are the ones
We get knocked down
We get back up and stand above the crowd
We are one
We are the ones
We get knocked down
We get back up and stand above the crowd
We are one

The life I think about
Is so much better than this
I never thought I'd be stuck in this mess
I'm sick of wondering
Is it life or death?

We are the ones
We get knocked down
We get back up and stand above the crowd
We are one
We are the ones
We get knocked down
We get back up and stand above the crowd
We are one

We stand above the crowd
We stand above the crowd
We stand above the crowd (Crowd)
(We stand) We stand above the crowd
We stand above the crowd (We Stand)
We stand above the crowd

(We are the ones) We stand above the crowd
(We get knocked down get back up) We stand above the crowd
(We are the ones) We stand above the crowd
(We get knocked down get back up) We stand above the crowd

We stand above the crowd
We stand above the crowd
We stand above the crowd

I walk alone
Think of home
Memories of long ago
No one knows I lost my soul long ago

Lied too much
She said that she's had enough
Am I too much
She said that she's had enough

Standing on my own
Remembering the one I left at home
Forget about the life I used to know
Forget about the one I left at home

I need to run far away
Can't go back to that place
Like she told me
I'm just a big disgrace

Lied too much
She said that she's had enough
Am I too much
She said that she's had enough

Standing on my own
Remembering the one I left at home
Forget about the life I used to know
Forget about the one I left at home
So now I'm standing here alone
I'm learning how to live life on my own

Lied too much
I think that I've had enough
Am I too much
She said that she's had enough

I'm standing on my own
Remembering the one I left at home
Forget about the life I used to know
Forget about the one I left at home
So now I'm standing here alone
I'm learning how to live life on my own
Forget about the past I'll never know
Forget about the one I left at home

I feel it everyday it's all the same
It brings me down but I'm the one to blame
I've tried everything to get away
So here I go again
Chasing you down again
Why do I do this?

Over and over, over and over
I fall for you
Over and over, over and over
I try not to

It feels like everyday stays the same
It's dragging me down and I can't pull away
So here I go again
Chasing you down again
Why do I do this?

Over and over, over and over
I fall for you
Over and over, over and over
I try not to
Over and over, over and over
You make me fall for you
Over and over, over and over
You don't even try

So many thoughts that I can't get out of my head
I try to live without you, every time I do I feel dead
I know what's best for me
But I want you instead
I'll keep on wasting all my time

Over and over, over and over
I fall for you
Over and over, over and over
I try not to
Over and over, over and over
You make me fall for you
Over and over, over and over
You don't even try to 
Worn out and faded
The weakness starts to show
They’ve created the generation
That we know
Washed up and hated
The system moves to slow
They give us answers
To questions they don’t even know

You made it
You played it
Your shit is overrated
You made it
You played it
Your shit is overrated

Used up and jaded
You’re thinking way to slow
So we’re creating
Answers on our own
We can’t relate
To what you think you know
And you create
The problems that will never
Go away

You made it
You played it
Your shit is overrated
You made it
You played it
Your shit is overrated

You made it
You played it
Your shit is overrated
You made it
You played it
Your shit is overrated

(Go away, go away, go away, go away)

You made it
You played it
Your shit is overrated
You made it
You played it
Your shit is overrated

You made it
You played it
Your shit is overrated
You made it
You played it
Your shit is overrated
Your shit is overrated
Pain, without love
Pain, I can't get enough
Pain, I like it rough
'Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all

You're sick of feeling numb
You're not the only one
I'll take you by the hand
And I'll show you a world that you can understand
This life is filled with hurt
When happiness doesn't work
Trust me and take my hand
When the lights go out you will understand

Pain, without love
Pain, can't get enough
Pain, I like it rough
'Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all
Pain, without love
Pain, can't get enough
Pain, I like it rough
'Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all

Anger and agony
Are better than misery
Trust me I've got a plan
When the lights go off you'll understand

Pain, without love
Pain, can't get enough
Pain, I like it rough
'Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all
Pain, without love
Pain, can't get enough
Pain, I like it rough
'Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing
Rather feel pain

I know (I know I know I know)
I know that you're wounded
You know (You know you know you know)
That I'm here to save you
You know (You know you know you know)
I'm always here for you
I know (I know I know I know)
That you'll thank me later

Pain, without love
Pain, can't get enough

If you feel so empty
So used up, so let down
If you feel so angry
So ripped off so stepped on
You're not the only one
Refusing to back down
You're not the only one
So get up

Let's start a riot, a riot
Let's start a riot
Let's start a riot, a riot
Let's start a riot

If you feel so filthy
So dirty so fucked up
If you feel so walked on
So painful so pissed off
You're not the only one
Refusing to go down
You're not the only one
So get up

Let's start a riot, a riot
Let's start a riot
Let's start a riot, a riot
Let's start a riot

If you feel so empty
So used up, so let down
If you feel so angry
Just get up

Let's start a riot, a riot
Let's start a riot
Let's start a riot, a riot
Let's start a riot

I'm thinking to myself
That I've done something wrong
That I've crossed the line
Have you found out this time
What led you to believe
It's only you and me
Do you see it in my eyes
Have you found out this time

You see right through me
Cause you're running away
You keep turning your back on me
I tried so hard
But you're running away
Please dont turn your back on me

I'm drinking by myself
And oh, I'm going down
But will you pick me up
Will you leave me on the ground
I led you to believe
It's only you and me
I can see it in your eyes
That you found out this time

You see right through me
Cause you're running away
You keep turning your back on me
I tried so hard
But you're running away
Please dont turn your back on me

Don't just turn and walk away
I can learn from my mistakes
Don't throw everything away

You see right through me
Cause you're running away
You keep turning your back on me
I tried so hard
But you're running away
But you're running away

You see right through me
Cause you're running away
You keep turning your back on me
I tried so hard
But you're running away
Please dont turn your back on me


At night I hear it creeping
At night I feel it move
I’ll never sleep here anymore

I wish you never told me
I wish I never knew
I wake up screaming
It’s all because of you

So real these voices in my head
When it comes back you won’t be
Scared and lonely
You won’t be scared, you won’t be
You won’t be scared and lonely
You won’t be scared you won’t be lonely

I know there’s something out there
I think I hear it move
I’ve never felt like this before
I wish you never told me
I wish I never knew
I wake up screaming
It’s all because of you

So real these voices in my head
When it comes back you won’t be
Scared and lonely
You won’t be scared, you won’t be
You won’t be scared and lonely
You won’t be scared you won’t be lonely

Its all because of you
I wish you never told me
I wake up screaming now
So real these voices in my head
So real these voices in my head
I wake up screaming now
I wish you never told me
I wish I never knew

Scared and lonely
You won’t be scared, you won’t be
You won’t be scared and lonely
You won’t be scared you won’t be lonely

Scared and lonely
You won’t be scared, you won’t be
You won’t be scared and lonely
You won’t be scared you won’t be lonely

Now it seems I’m fading
All my dreams are not worth saving
I’ve done my share of waiting
And I’ve still got nowhere else to go
So I wait for you to
Take me all the way
Take me all the way

Seems you’re wanting me to stay
But my dreams would surely waste away
And I still have nowhere else to go
So I wait for you to
Take me all the way
Take me all the way

Push me under
Pull me further
Take me all the way
Take me all the way

Push me under
Pull me further
Take me all the way
Take me all the way

Now it seems you’re leaving
But we’ve only just begun
And you’ve still got nowhere else to go
So I wait for you to
Take me all the way
Take me all the way

Push me under
Pull me further
Take me all the way
Take me all the way

Push me under
Pull me further
Take me all the way
Take me all the way

And I’ve been waiting so long
And I’ve been waiting so long
And I’ve been waiting so long

So I wait for you to
Take me all the way

Push me under
Pull me further
Take me all the way
Take me all the way

Push me under
Pull me further
Take me all the way
Take me all the way

And I’ve been waiting so long
And I’ve been waiting so long
And I’ve been waiting so long

So I wait for you to
Take me all the way
Take me all the way 
The good life is
What I need
Too many people
Stepping over me
The only thing that's
Been on my mind
Is the one thing I need before I die

All I want is a little of
The good life
All I need is to have
A good time
The good life

I don't really know
Who I am
It's time for me
To take a stand
I need a change
And I need it fast
I know that any day
Could be the last

All I want is a little of
The good life
All I need is to have
A good time
The good life
All I want is a little of
The good life
All I need is to have
A good time
The good life

Hold on, hold on
I always wanted it this way
I never wanted it this way
Hold on, hold on
I always wanted it this way
We didn't ask for it this way
I always wanted this way

All I want is a little of
The good life
All I need is to have
A good time
The good life
All I want is a little of
The good life
All I need is to have
A good time
The good life
On the ground I lay
Motionless in pain
I can see my life flashing before my eyes
Did I fall asleep?
Is this all a dream
Wake me up, I'm living a nightmare

I will not die (I will not die)
I will survive

I will not die, I'll wait here for you
I feel alive, when you're beside me
I will not die, I'll wait here for you
In my time of dying

On this bed I lay
Losing everything
I can see my life passing me by
Was it all too much
Or just not enough
Wake me up, I'm living a nightmare

I will not die (I will not die)
I will survive

I will not die, I'll wait here for you
I feel alive, when you're beside me
I will not die, I'll wait here for you
In my time of dying

I will not die, I'll wait here for you
I feel alive, when you're beside me
I will not die, I'll wait here for you
In my time of dying
I will not die, I'll wait here for you
I will not die, when you're beside me
I will not die, I'll wait here for you
In my time of dying 
I’m not sober all the time
You bring me down at least you try
Until we see this eye to eye
I don’t want you

I must be running out of luck
Cause you’re just not drunk enough to fuck
And now I’ve had it up to here
I don’t, I don’t want you

It took so long to see
You walked away from me
When I need you
Wake up I’m pounding on the door
I’m not the man I was before
Where the hell are you
When I need you
Wake up I’m pounding on the door
I won’t hurt you anymore
Where the hell are you
When I need you

I’m not angry all the time
You push me down at least you try
Until we see this eye to eye
I don’t want you

It took so long to see
You walked away from me
When I need you
Wake up I’m pounding on the door
I’m not the man I was before
Where the hell are you
When I need you
Wake up I’m pounding on the door
I won’t hurt you anymore
Where the hell are you
When I need you

It took so long to see
You walked away from me
When I need you

Wake up I’m pounding on the door
I’m not the man I was before
Where the hell are you
When I need you
Wake up I’m pounding on the door
I won’t hurt you anymore
Where the hell are you
When I need you

I never thought
I'd feel this
Guilty and I'm
Broken down inside
Living with myself
Nothing but lies

I always thought
I'd make it
But never knew I'd
Let it get so bad
Living with myself
Is all I have

I feel numb
I can't come to life
I feel like
I'm frozen in time

Living in a
World so cold
Wasting away
Living in a shell
With no soul
Since you've gone away
Living in a world so cold
Counting the days
Since you've gone away
You've gone away

Do you ever feel me
Do you ever look
Deep down inside
Staring at yourself
Paralyzed

I feel numb
I can't come to life
I feel like
I'm frozen in time

Living in a
World so cold
Wasting away
Living in a shell
With no soul
Since you've gone away
Living in a world so cold
Counting the days
Since you've gone away
You've gone away from me

I'm too young
To lose my soul
I'm too young
To feel this old
So long
I'm left behind
I feel like
I'm losing my mind

Do you ever feel me
Do you ever look
Deep down inside
Staring at your life
Paralyzed

Living in a
World so cold
Wasting away
Living in a shell
With no soul
Since you've gone away
Living in a world so cold
Counting the days
Since you've gone away
You've gone away
From me

I'm too young
I'm too young
