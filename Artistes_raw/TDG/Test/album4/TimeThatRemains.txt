Don’t do as I have done
Win where I have lost
Have where I have none
Don’t let your demons drive
They’ll just steer you wrong
You won’t get out alive

Because you can’t unlive the pain
You can’t rewind to yesterday
You might never find your place
In the time that remains
So if tomorrow never comes
From living fast and dying young
I hope the best is yet to come
In the time that remains for you

Don’t get me wrong
The mistakes I’ve made along the way
Made me who I am today
The time is gonna come
You will wake up and realize
Just how fast your life goes by

Because you can’t unlive the pain
You can’t rewind to yesterday
You might never find your place
In the time that remains
So if tomorrow never comes
From living fast and dying young
I hope the best is yet to come
In the time that remains for you

Because you can’t unlive the pain
You can’t rewind to yesterday
You might never find your place
In the time that remains
So if tomorrow never comes
From living fast and dying young
I hope the best is yet to come
In the time that remains for you

The time that remains for you
For you
The time that remains
The time that remains
