Feed on me
You know I’m never far
Feed off me
Like a vulture on a deer hit by a car
I can only do so much
And of course it’s never enough
I don’t think that you see
Exactly what you’re doing to me

Don’t speak
Don’t speak

Give me a reason to turn and run
Give me a reason to burn this house down
Give me a reason I wish you would
I wish you would
Wish you would

Give me a reason for disaster
And I’ll be happy ever after
Give me a reason I wish you would
I wish you would
Wish you would

So you've tried your best
To get out of this mess
But that’s just a joke
You’ve never awoke
To the sound of a mother screaming at night

Don’t speak
Don’t speak

Give me a reason to turn and run
Give me a reason to burn this house down
Give me a reason I wish you would
I wish you would
Wish you would

Give me a reason for disaster
And I’ll be happy ever after
Give me a reason I wish you would
I'd wish you would
Wish you would

I wish you would
Wish you would
Wish you would
Wish you would
Wish you would

Give me a reason to turn and run
Give me a reason to burn this house down
Give me a reason I wish you would
I wish you would
Wish you would

Give me a reason for disaster
And I’ll be happy ever after
Give me a reason to turn and run
I wish you would
I wish you would
