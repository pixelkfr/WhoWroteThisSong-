This is a sign of the times
Another mountain to climb
The sun burns as hot as the flame in the devil’s eyes
This is a sign of the times
Another mountain to climb
The sun burns as hot as the flame in the devil’s eyes

There’s chaos on the rise
The sky is raining knives
We have mistaken
The toll that is taken on you and I
You and I
You and I
You and I

There’s chaos on the rise
The sky is raining knives
We have mistaken
The toll that is taken on you and I

The oceans have gone dry
Venus is passing by
You and I
You and I
You and I

There’s chaos on the rise
The sky is raining knives
We have mistaken
The toll that is taken on you and I

I gave you what you need
I gave you what you need
You and
You and
You and
I gave what you need

We have mistaken
The toll that is taken on
We have mistaken
The toll that is taken on

I gave you what you need
I gave you what you need
I gave you what you need
