I reach out when I have a confession
I reach out in desperation
I reach out when no one is listening
So I go looking for the next best thing

Happiness straight from the bottle
When real life’s too hard to swallow
Happiness straight from the bottle
When real life’s too hard to swallow

I feel them judging on me for their own pleasure
If they really knew they’d know better
That I’m the one who caves under pressure
When desperate times call for desperate measures

Happiness straight from the bottle
When real life’s too hard to swallow
Happiness straight from the bottle
When real life’s too hard to swallow

I know there’s got to be some peace in me
But I can’t find it
I get so sick of looking

Happiness straight from the bottle
When real life’s too hard to swallow
Happiness straight from the bottle
When real life’s too hard to swallow

Too hard to swallow
