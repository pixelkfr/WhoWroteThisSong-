I know how you’re operating
Only come around when you know that I need it
Cut out my heart and you leave me bleeding
But you’re the only one that brings out the demon

Like pills you make me righteous
Like I can rise above it all
Like pills you leave me lifeless
Shaken in a bathroom stall

Why you wanna do this
Don’t want to see you in my phone
Leave me alone

I know how you’re operating
Only come around when you know that I need it
Cut out my heart and you leave me bleeding
You’re the only one that brings out the demon

You bring it out
You bring it out

Like pills you grab a hold of me
One hit just makes me want you more
Until we’re in a motel room
Locked up behind closed doors

Why you wanna do this
Don’t want to see you in my phone
Leave me alone

I know how you’re operating
Only come around when you know that I need it
Cut out my heart and you leave me bleeding
You’re the only one that brings out the demon

You bring it out
You bring it out

You’re doing it now
You’re doing it now
You’re doing it now

It used to be
You brought out the best in me
Now it seems
You bring out the beast in me

I know how you’re operating
Only come around when you know that I need it
Cut out my heart and you leave me bleeding
You are the only one that brings out the demon

You bring it out
(You bring it out)
You bring it out
(You bring it out)
You bring it out
(You bring it out)
