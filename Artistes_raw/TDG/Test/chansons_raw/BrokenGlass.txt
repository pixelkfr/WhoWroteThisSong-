All we are is broken glass
Thrown to the floor we were never meant to last
And all we are are empty shells
Try to pick us up you’re gonna cut yourself

We march the streets at night
Looking for a thrill, looking for a fight
It was the first day of the rest of our lives
We work fast, never gonna die
Riding up the highway, forty-five
We didn’t know it couldn’t go on forever

All we are is broken glass
Thrown to the floor we were never meant to last
And all we are are empty shells
Try to pick us up you’re gonna cut yourself

We fought to rule the world
Not knowing just how fragile we really were
Like it was the first day of the rest of our lives
Then the bricks began to fall
And we can see the cracks along the wall
We didn’t know it couldn’t go on forever

All we are is broken glass
Thrown to the floor we were never meant to last
And all we are are empty shells
Try to pick us up you’re gonna cut yourself

We believe that we can go on forever
We believe that we can go on forever
Forever

All we are is broken glass
Thrown to the floor we were never meant to last
And all we are are empty shells
Try to pick us up you’re gonna cut yourself

You cut yourself
You’re gonna cut yourself
You’re gonna cut yourself
