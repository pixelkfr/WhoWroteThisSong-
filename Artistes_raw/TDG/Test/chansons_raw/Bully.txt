He wakes up haunted
With voices in his head
Nobody knows it but today
He won't go unnoticed
He can't forget
Can't forgive
For what they said
He's never been
So hurt but
Today the screaming
Is over

Blame the family
Blame the bully
Blame it on me
Maybe he needed to be wanted
Blame the family
Blame the bully
Blame it on me
Maybe he needed to be wanted

She takes the long way home
Fighting her emotions
She's a loner but tonight
She won't go unnoticed
If she can't remember when
She loses her temper
Nobody knows her but tonight
The silence is over

Blame the family
Blame the bully
Blame it on me
Maybe she needed to be wanted
Blame the family
Blame the bully
Blame it on me
Maybe she needed to be wanted

Blame the family
Blame the bully
Blame it on me
Maybe they needed to be wanted
Blame the family
Blame the bully
Blame it on me
Maybe they needed
To be wanted
