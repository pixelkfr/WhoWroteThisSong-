Took me down to the river
So I could drown, drown, drown
Looking up through the water
I kept sinking down, down, down

I feel like I'm dying
I got one foot in the ground
Never knew what love was
Until you came around

You're going down
You're going down, down
You walked all over me
You never thought I'd be
The one who's laughing now
Now that you're going down

Take you down to the basement
You look around-round-round
We sit there in silence
I watched you go down, down, down

I feel like I'm flying
I got my head in the clouds
Never thought I was crazy
Until you came around

You're going down
You're going down, down
You walked all over me
You never thought I'd be
The one who's laughing now
Now that you're going down

You're going down, down
You walked all over me
You never thought I'd be
The one who's laughing now
Now that you're going down

Took me down to the river
So I could drown, drown, drown

You're going down
You're going down, down
You walked all over me
You never thought I'd be
The one who's laughing now
Now that you're going down (down, down, down)

You're going down, down (down)
You walked all over me
You never thought I'd be
The one who's laughing now
Now that you're going down
