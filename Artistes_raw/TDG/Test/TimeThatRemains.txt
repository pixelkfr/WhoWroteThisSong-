don t do as i have done.
win where i have lost.
have where i have none.
don t let your demons drive.
they will just steer you wrong.
you won t get out alive.
because you can t unlive the pain.
you can t rewind to yesterday.
you might never find your place.
in the time that remains.
so if tomorrow never comes.
from living fast and dying young.
i hope the best is yet to come.
in the time that remains for you.
don t get me wrong.
the mistakes i have made along the way.
made me who i am today.
the time is gonna come.
you will wake up and realize.
just how fast your life goes by.
because you can t unlive the pain.
you can t rewind to yesterday.
you might never find your place.
in the time that remains.
so if tomorrow never comes.
from living fast and dying young.
i hope the best is yet to come.
in the time that remains for you.
because you can t unlive the pain.
you can t rewind to yesterday.
you might never find your place.
in the time that remains.
so if tomorrow never comes.
from living fast and dying young.
i hope the best is yet to come.
in the time that remains for you.
the time that remains for you.
for you.
the time that remains.
the time that remains.
