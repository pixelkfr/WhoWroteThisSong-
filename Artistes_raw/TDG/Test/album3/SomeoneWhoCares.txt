Every street in this city
Is the same to me
Everyone's got a place to be
But there's no room for me
Am I to blame?
When the guilt and the shame
Hang over me
Like a dark cloud that
Chases you down
In the pouring rain

It's so hard
To find someone
Who cares about you
But it's easy enough to find
Someone who looks down on you
Why is it so hard
To find someone
Who cares about you
But it's easy enough to find
Someone who looks down on you?

It's not what it seems
When you're not on the scene
There's a chill in the air
But there's people like me
That nobody sees
So nobody cares

Why is it so hard
To find someone
Who cares about you
When it's easy enough to find
Someone who looks down on you?
Why is it so hard to find
Someone who can keep it
Together when you've come undone?
Why is it so hard
To find someone
Who cares about you?

I swear this time
It won't turn out the same
Cause now I've
Got myself to blame
And you'll know when we
End up on the streets
That it's easy enough to find
Someone who looks down on you

Why is it so hard
To find someone
Who cares about you
When it's easy enough to find
Someone who looks down on you?
Why is it so hard to find
Someone who can keep it
Together when you've come undone
Why is it so hard
To find someone
Who cares about you?
