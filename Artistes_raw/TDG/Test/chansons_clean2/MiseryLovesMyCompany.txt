i am in control.
i haven t lost my mind.
i am picking up the pieces.
of the past you left behind.
i don t need your condescending.
words about me looking lonely.
i don t need your arms to hold me.
cause misery is waiting on me.
i am not alone.
not beaten down just yet.
i am not afraid.
of the voices in my head.
down the darkest road.
something follows me.
i am not alone.
cause misery loves my company.
misery loves my company.
leave me in the cold.
you better run away.
i am gonna dig a hole.
and bury all the memories we have made.
i don t need your condescending.
words about me looking lonely.
i don t need your arms to hold me.
cause misery is waiting on me.
i am not alone.
not beaten down just yet.
i am not afraid.
of the voices in my head.
down the darkest road.
something follows me.
i am not alone.
cause misery loves my company.
misery loves my company.
i am not alone.
not beaten down just yet.
i am not afraid.
of the voices in my head.
down the darkest road.
something follows me.
i am not alone.
cause misery loves my company.
misery loves my company.
