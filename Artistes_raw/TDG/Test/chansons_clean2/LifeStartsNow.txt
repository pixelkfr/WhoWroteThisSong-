you say you feel so down.
every time i turn around.
you say you should have.
been gone by now.
you think that everything s wrong.
ask me how to carry on.
we will make it through.
another day.
just hold on.
cause life starts now.
you have done all the things.
that could kill you somehow.
and you are so far down.
but you will survive this.
somehow because.
life starts now.
i hate to see you fall down.
i will pick you up off the ground.
i have watched the weight of.
your world come down.
and now it s your chance.
to move on change the way you have lived for so long.
find the strength you have had inside all along.
cause life starts now.
you have done all the things.
that could kill you somehow.
and you are so far down.
but you will survive this.
somehow because.
life starts now.
all this pain.
take this life and make it yours.
all this hate.
take your heart and let it love again.
you will survive this somehow.
life starts now.
you have done all the things.
that could kill you somehow.
and you are so far down.
life starts now.
you have done all the things.
that could kill you somehow.
and you are so far down.
life starts now.
