took me down to the river.
so i could drown drown drown.
looking up through the water.
i kept sinking down down down.
i feel like i am dying.
i got one foot in the ground.
never knew what love was.
until you came around.
you are going down.
you are going down down.
you walked all over me.
you never thought i d be.
the one who s laughing now.
now that you are going down.
take you down to the basement.
you look around round round.
we sit there in silence.
i watched you go down down down.
i feel like i am flying.
i got my head in the clouds.
never thought i was crazy.
until you came around.
you are going down.
you are going down down.
you walked all over me.
you never thought i d be.
the one who s laughing now.
now that you are going down.
you are going down down.
you walked all over me.
you never thought i d be.
the one who s laughing now.
now that you are going down.
took me down to the river.
so i could drown drown drown.
you are going down.
you are going down down.
you walked all over me.
you never thought i d be.
the one who s laughing now.
now that you are going down down down down.
you are going down down down.
you walked all over me.
you never thought i d be.
the one who s laughing now.
now that you are going down.
