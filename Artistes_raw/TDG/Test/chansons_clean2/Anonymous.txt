in my mind worlds collide.
something inside me is gone.
still i keeping going on.
in my mind oceans divide.
i don t know where i belong.
but still i keep holding on and on.
i get by in a world with no conscience.
by shutting it out and being anonymous.
and the problem is you are just like me.
we get by in a world with no conscience.
by shutting it out and being anonymous.
hello hello hello.
