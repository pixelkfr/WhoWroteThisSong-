feed on me.
you know i am never far.
feed off me.
like a vulture on a deer hit by a car.
i can only do so much.
and of course it s never enough.
i don t think that you see.
exactly what you are doing to me.
don t speak.
don t speak.
give me a reason to turn and run.
give me a reason to burn this house down.
give me a reason i wish you would.
i wish you would.
wish you would.
give me a reason for disaster.
and i will be happy ever after.
give me a reason i wish you would.
i wish you would.
wish you would.
so you have tried your best.
to get out of this mess.
but that s just a joke.
you have never awoke.
to the sound of a mother screaming at night.
don t speak.
don t speak.
give me a reason to turn and run.
give me a reason to burn this house down.
give me a reason i wish you would.
i wish you would.
wish you would.
give me a reason for disaster.
and i will be happy ever after.
give me a reason i wish you would.
i d wish you would.
wish you would.
i wish you would.
wish you would.
wish you would.
wish you would.
wish you would.
give me a reason to turn and run.
give me a reason to burn this house down.
give me a reason i wish you would.
i wish you would.
wish you would.
give me a reason for disaster.
and i will be happy ever after.
give me a reason to turn and run.
i wish you would.
i wish you would.
