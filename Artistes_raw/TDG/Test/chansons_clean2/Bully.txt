he wakes up haunted.
with voices in his head.
nobody knows it but today.
he won t go unnoticed.
he can t forget.
can t forgive.
for what they said.
he s never been.
so hurt but.
today the screaming.
is over.
blame the family.
blame the bully.
blame it on me.
maybe he needed to be wanted.
blame the family.
blame the bully.
blame it on me.
maybe he needed to be wanted.
she takes the long way home.
fighting her emotions.
she s a loner but tonight.
she won t go unnoticed.
if she can t remember when.
she loses her temper.
nobody knows her but tonight.
the silence is over.
blame the family.
blame the bully.
blame it on me.
maybe she needed to be wanted.
blame the family.
blame the bully.
blame it on me.
maybe she needed to be wanted.
blame the family.
blame the bully.
blame it on me.
maybe they needed to be wanted.
blame the family.
blame the bully.
blame it on me.
maybe they needed.
to be wanted.
