i told you i was hurt.
bleeding on the inside.
i told you i was lost.
in the middle of my life.
there s times i stayed alive for you.
there s times i would have died for you.
there s times it didn t matter at all.
will you help me find the right way up.
or let me take the wrong way down.
will you straighten me out.
or make me take the long way around.
i took the low road in.
i will take the high road out.
i will do whatever it takes.
to be the mistake you can t live without.
standing in the dark.
i can see your shadow.
you are the only light.
that s breaking through the window.
there s times i stayed alive for you.
there s times i would have died for you.
there s times it didn t matter at all.
will you help me find the right way up.
or let me take the wrong way down.
will you straighten me out.
or make me take the long way around.
i took the low road in.
i will take the high road out.
i will do whatever it takes.
to be the mistake you can t live without.
we will i am not gonna give it away.
not gonna let it go just to wake up someday gone gone.
the worst part is looking back.
and knowing that i was wrong.
help me find the right way up.
or let me take the wrong way down.
will you straighten me out.
or make me take the long way around.
i took the low road in.
i will take the high road out.
i will do whatever it takes.
to be the mistake you can t live without.
i will do whatever it takes.
to be the mistake you can t live without.
