Just let me say one thing
I've had enough
You're selfish and sorry
You'll never learn
How to love
As your world disassembles
Better keep your head up

Your name,
Your face is
All you have left now
Betrayed, disgraced
You've been erased

So long, so long
I have erased you
So long, so long
I've wanted to waste you
So long, so long
I have erased you
I have escaped
The bitter taste of you

Just let me clear my head
I think I've had too much
You're so disappointing
But you make good use of it

As your world disassembles
Better keep your head up

Your name,
Your face is
All you have left now
Betrayed, disgraced
You've been erased

So long, so long
I have erased you
So long, so long
I've wanted to waste you
So long, so long
I have erased you
I have escaped
The bitter taste of you

Your name,
Your face is
All you have left now
Disgraced, betrayed
You've been erased

So long, so long
I have erased you
So long, so long
I've wanted to waste you
So long, so long
I have erased you
I have escaped
The bitter taste ...
I have escaped
The bitter taste of you
