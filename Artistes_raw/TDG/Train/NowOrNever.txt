In this time are we loving
Or do we sit here wondering
Why this world isn’t turning round
It’s now or never

We have no use
For the truth
And now’s the time for us to lose
Who we are and how we’ve tried
Taking every step in stride
It now or never to decide

In this time are we loving
Or do we sit here wondering
Why this world isn’t turning round
It’s now or never

In this way are we learning
Or do we sit here yearning
For this world to stop turning round
It’s now or never

Where’s the truth
For us to use
Cause all we seem to do is lose
Who we are and how we’ve tried
Are we all the same inside
It’s now or never to decide

In this time are we loving
Or do we sit here wondering
Why this world isn’t turning round
It’s now or never

In this way are we learning
Or do we sit here yearning
For this world to stop turning round
It’s now or never

In this time are we loving
Or do we sit here wondering
Why this world isn’t turning round
It’s now or never

In this time are we loving
Or do we sit here wondering
Why this world isn’t turning round
It’s now or never

In this way are we learning
Or do we sit here yearning
For this world to stop turning round
It’s now or never

In this time are we loving,
Wondering
Isn’t turning round
It’s now or never
