Let me tell ya 'bout a girl I know
That comes alive when you take off her clothes
There's no tellin' just where she's been
Ask around but no one seems to know, yeah

Late at night when you're looking for sin
Call her up and she'll lay down the law
You can't trust her 'cause she'll lie to your face
But that's not why you gave her a call

You're waste deep inside
The lust and burning desire

We've all been more than eager to sin
And it feels alright, 'til we pay the price
Now you choose either naughty or nice
'Cause she's here for you
It's all yours tonight
You won't believe the stories I've been told
About a girl I know

Another thing about this girl I know
She's more comfortable down on her knees
Went to school, got a job, and then she shot into hell
All 'cause she's born to please, yeah

Don't get her mixed up 'cause she knows what she likes
Can tell the difference between right and wrong
She knows you're watching every one of her moves
Just more reason to string you along, yeah

You're waste deep inside
The lust and burning desire

We've all been more than eager to sin
And it feels alright, 'til we pay the price
Now you choose either naughty or nice
'Cause she's here for you
It's all yours tonight
You won't believe the stories I've been told
About a girl I know

The first times hard enough
But you made it through
The seconds time I see the changes in you
She's got you somehow
You're needing her now, yeah

We've all been more than eager to sin
And it feels alright, 'til we pay the price
Now you choose either naughty or nice
'Cause she's here for you
It's all yours tonight
You won't believe the stories I've been told
About a girl I know
