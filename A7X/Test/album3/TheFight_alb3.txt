The problem with society's been how do we teach
And if they'll believe.
We'll fight this battle for years to come
'Til we all accept that we can stand on our own.
Grandfather used his hands, he worked them to the bone.
Provide his family with a happy home, alone.

Don't take your aggression out on me.
My own man is all I'm meant to be.

This common place is so lazy, old, and tired
All your ideas are so fucking uninspired.
Takes more than one idea
More than one person to fight the fight
How many times have you taught and not conspired?

You don't wanna be, they never say
But don't call us the liars

We've walked these alleys a thousand times
And scattered around a thousand lies.
They are trying to hold you down
Your life may be hard
But keep your feet on the ground.
Why don't I have the finer things that others have?
The chance is there if you want it all that bad.
So bad.

Don't take your aggression out on me.
My own man is all I'm meant to be.

This common place is so lazy, old, and tired
All your ideas are so fucking uninspired.
Takes more than one idea
More than one person to fight the fight
How many times have you taught and not conspired?

Don't try and get me confused.
Cause I do understand.
And sometimes people need help.
That they may need a hand
When this problems going on.
A thing you have to get straight
Is that you don't own my hand.
And I don't owe you a thing.
So don't think about how sorry you feel
And now you're treated so bad.

This common place is so lazy, old, and tired
All your ideas are so fucking uninspired.
Takes more than one idea
More than one person to fight the fight
How many times have you taught and not conspired?

And as we race we look back and we've come so far.
While some may conquer, the others had it so hard.
But in this day we just complain while there's no one for us to fight.
I guess we're bored and it's how we keep us occupied
