I wake up every morning, bright and early
Roll out of bed but I'm never quite alone
Tension is pulling me in all directions
And all of these problems use me as their own
Sometimes the pressure will just drive you crazy
At any time I could explode
I need some piece of mind, it's got me tired
Don't wanna lose it, but I'm turning down that road

I need a moment 'cause I've spread myself to thin
We all need a moment in our life
Works hard, the days too long
And that's just where it begins
Tension has had us all this time

I sit in traffic every single morning
Just as I arrive, I'm slaving to the grind
Making the money so I feed my family
But I can't raise them, 'cause I ain't got the time
I got no free days on my busy schedule
I turn the page and it's the same
Don't like my situation, you don't either
Don't wanna look back scared, I'm working life away

I need a moment 'cause I've spread myself to thin
We all need a moment in our life
Works hard, the days too long
And that's just where it begins
Tension has had us all this time

But every now and then
I drive alone
An open road
Hot summer day
A gentle breeze that feels alright
All alone
And I can't feel no pain
Only strength
Enjoy the sights
I feel alive
Relaxing here just feels alright
Far from home

I need a moment 'cause I've spread myself to thin
We all need a moment in our life
Works hard, the days too long
And that's just where it begins
Tension has had us all this time
