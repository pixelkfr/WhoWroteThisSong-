Hey kid
(Hey kid)
Do I have your attention?
I know the way you've been livin'
Life so reckless, tragedy endless
Welcome to the family
Hey
There's somethin' missin'
Only time will alter your vision
Never in question, lethal injection
Welcome to the family

Not long ago you'd find the answers were so crystal clear
Within a day you find yourself livin' in constant fear
Can you look at yourself now?
Can you look at yourself?!
You can't win this fight

And in a way it seems there's no one to call
When our thoughts are so numb and
Our feelings unsure
We all have emptiness inside
We all have answers to find
But you can't win this fight

Hey
(Hey Kid)
I have to question,
What's with the violent aggression?
Details blurry, lost 'em too early
Welcome to the family
Hey
Why won't you listen?
Can't help the people you're missin'
It's been done, a casualty re-run
Welcome to the family

I'll try and help you with the things that can't be justified
I need to warn you that there is no way to rationalize
So have you figured it out now?
So have you figured it out?!
You can't win this fight

And in a way it seems there's no one to call
When our thoughts are so numb and
Our feelings unsure
We all have emptiness inside
We all have answers to find
But you can't win this fight

Coming for you
And all mankind
I've lost my mind
Psychotic, Rapid dementia
I won't be fine

I see, you're a king who's been dethroned
(Been dethroned)
Cast out, in a world you've never known
(Never known)
Stand down; Place your weapon by your side
(By your side)
It's our war; In the end we'll surely lose but that's all right
(You'll surely lose to me)

So have you figured it out now?
So have you figured it out?!

And, in a way it seems there's no-one to call
When our thoughts are so numb and
Our feelings unsure
We all have emptiness inside
We all have answers to find
But you can't win this fight

Keep inside
Where nothing's fine
I lost my mind
You're not invited
So step aside
I lost my

Keep inside
Where nothing's fine
I lost my mind
You're not invited
So step aside
I lost my
