Skull!

Aaaah

They all know
They all know

Sorry did I wake your dreams?
Some questions run too deep
We only only wake up when we sleep
Led by the lunar light, trouble's all we'd find
Lost our way tonight

Is it something we said?
Is it something we said to them?
Is it something we said?

Save me -
I'm trapped in a vile world,
Where the endings are the same as every other
We're only here to die
Save me -
I'm losing my only dream,
I can use some guiding light, some place to go
If you hear me let me know

They all know
They all know

Ever since the day you left my fate's been set unknown
How many years to walk this path alone?
So much to see tonight, so why'd you close your eyes?
Why can't I shut mine?

Is it something we did?
Is it something we did to them?
Is it something we did?

Save me -
I'm trapped in a vile world
Where the endings are the same as every other
We're only here to die
Save me -
I'm losing my only dream
I can use some guiding light, some place to go
If you hear me let me know, if you hear me let me know

Aaaah

Help me find my way
I said help me find my way
No pulse inside of me
Stone cold lips and heresy
All lies into a degree
Losing who I wanna be

You'll find out right now

He may be out of his mind, but some day you will find
That sanity's left us all blind, and dragged us all behind
A moment seen through those eyes, crystal blue disguise
They say that all beauty must die, I say it just moves on...

If you'd only open your mind, then someday you will find
Insanity left us behind, and walked right through the door
I can see the pictures clear as yesterday, pictures all my own
I can hear the voices begging you to stay, but know you're not alone

Save me -
I'm trapped in a vile world
Where the endings are the same as every other
We're only here to die
Save me -
I'm losing my only dream
I can use some guiding light, some place to go
If you hear me let me know, if you hear me let me know

Tonight we all die young
Tonight we all die young
Tonight we all die young
Tonight we all die young
Tonight we all die young
Tonight we all die young
Tonight we all die
Tonight we all die young
