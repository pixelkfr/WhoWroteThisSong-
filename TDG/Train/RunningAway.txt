I'm thinking to myself
That I've done something wrong
That I've crossed the line
Have you found out this time
What led you to believe
It's only you and me
Do you see it in my eyes
Have you found out this time

You see right through me
Cause you're running away
You keep turning your back on me
I tried so hard
But you're running away
Please dont turn your back on me

I'm drinking by myself
And oh, I'm going down
But will you pick me up
Will you leave me on the ground
I led you to believe
It's only you and me
I can see it in your eyes
That you found out this time

You see right through me
Cause you're running away
You keep turning your back on me
I tried so hard
But you're running away
Please dont turn your back on me

Don't just turn and walk away
I can learn from my mistakes
Don't throw everything away

You see right through me
Cause you're running away
You keep turning your back on me
I tried so hard
But you're running away
But you're running away

You see right through me
Cause you're running away
You keep turning your back on me
I tried so hard
But you're running away
Please dont turn your back on me
