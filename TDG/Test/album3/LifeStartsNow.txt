You say you feel so down,
Every time I turn around
You say you should've
Been gone by now,
You think that everything's wrong,
Ask me how to carry on,
We'll make it through
Another day
Just hold on

Cause life starts now,
You've done all the things
That could kill you somehow
And you're so far down
But you will survive this
Somehow because
Life starts now

I hate to see you fall down,
I'll pick you up off the ground,
I've watched the weight of
Your world come down
And now it's your chance
To move on, change the way you've lived for so long,
Find the strength you've had inside all along

Cause life starts now,
You've done all the things
That could kill you somehow
And you're so far down
But you will survive this
Somehow because
Life starts now

All this pain
Take this life and make it yours,
All this hate
Take your heart and let it love again,
You will survive this somehow

Life starts now,
You've done all the things
That could kill you somehow
And you're so far down

Life starts now,
You've done all the things
That could kill you somehow
And you're so far down
Life starts now
