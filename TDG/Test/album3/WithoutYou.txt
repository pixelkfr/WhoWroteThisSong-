What if I walked without you? What if I ran without you?
What if I stand without you? I could not go on
What if I lived without you?
What if I love without you?
What if I died without you?
I could not go on

You left my side tonight,
And I just don't feel right,
But I can't let you out of sight
Without you I'm no one,
I'm nothing at all

What if I lie without you?
What if I rise without you
And what if I dream without you?
I could not go on

You left my side tonight,
And I just don't feel right,
But I can't let you out of sight
Without you I'm no one,
I'm nothing at all
Nothing at all
