She always takes it with a heart of stone
‘Cause all she does is throw it back at me
I’ve spent a lifetime looking for someone

Don’t try to understand me
Simply do the things I say

Love is a feeling
Give it when I want it
‘Cause I’m on fire
Quench my desire
Give it when I want it
Talk to me woman
Give in to me
Give in to me

You always knew just how to make me cry
And never did I ask you questions why
It seems you get your kicks from hurting me

Don’t try to understand me
Because your words just are not enough

Love is a feeling
Quench my desire
Give it when I want it
Taken me higher
Love is a woman
Well I don’t wanna hear it
Give in to me
Give in to me

You and your friends are laughing at me now
But it’s ok
It’s ok

You won’t be laughing girl when I’m not around
I’ll be ok
I’m gonna find some peace of mind

(Give in to me)
(Give in to me)

Love is a feeling
Give it when I want it
‘Cause I’m on fire
Quench my desire
Give it when I want it
Talk to me woman
Give in to me
Give in to me

Love is a feeling
its taken me higher
Give it when I want it
‘Cause I’m on fire
Talk to me woman
Give it when I want it
Give in to me
Give in to me
