In my mind worlds collide
Something inside me is gone
Still I keeping going on
In my mind oceans divide
I don’t know where I belong
But still I keep holding on and on

I get by in a world with no conscience
By shutting it out and being anonymous
And the problem is you’re just like me
We get by in a world with no conscience
By shutting it out and being anonymous
Hello, hello, hello

In my mind worlds collide
Something inside me is gone
Still I keep going on
In my mind oceans divide
I don’t know where I belong
But still I keep holding on and on

I get by in a world with no conscience
By shutting it out and being anonymous
And the problem is you’re just like me
We get by in a world with no conscience
By shutting it out and being anonymous
Hello, hello, hello

Anonymous
(hello, hello, hello)
Is there anybody out there
(hello, hello, hello)

I get by in a world with no conscience
I try and I try but I am anonymous
And the problem is you’re just like me
Just like me

I get by in a world with no conscience
By shutting it out and being anonymous
And the problem is you’re just like me (just like me)
We get by in a world with no conscience
By shutting it out and being anonymous

(Hello, hello, hello)
We feel so anonymous
(Hello, hello, hello)
We feel so anonymous
(Hello, hello, hello)
