i know how you are operating.
only come around when you know that i need it.
cut out my heart and you leave me bleeding.
but you are the only one that brings out the demon.
like pills you make me righteous.
like i can rise above it all.
like pills you leave me lifeless.
shaken in a bathroom stall.
why you wanna do this.
don t want to see you in my phone.
leave me alone.
i know how you are operating.
only come around when you know that i need it.
cut out my heart and you leave me bleeding.
you are the only one that brings out the demon.
you bring it out.
you bring it out.
like pills you grab a hold of me.
one hit just makes me want you more.
until we are in a motel room.
locked up behind closed doors.
why you wanna do this.
don t want to see you in my phone.
leave me alone.
i know how you are operating.
only come around when you know that i need it.
cut out my heart and you leave me bleeding.
you are the only one that brings out the demon.
you bring it out.
you bring it out.
you are doing it now.
you are doing it now.
you are doing it now.
it used to be.
you brought out the best in me.
now it seems.
you bring out the beast in me.
i know how you are operating.
only come around when you know that i need it.
cut out my heart and you leave me bleeding.
you are the only one that brings out the demon.
you bring it out.
you bring it out.
you bring it out.
you bring it out.
you bring it out.
you bring it out.
