what if i walked without you what if i ran without you.
what if i stand without you i could not go on.
what if i lived without you.
what if i love without you.
what if i died without you.
i could not go on.
you left my side tonight.
and i just don t feel right.
but i can t let you out of sight.
without you i am no one.
i am nothing at all.
what if i lie without you.
what if i rise without you.
and what if i dream without you.
i could not go on.
you left my side tonight.
and i just don t feel right.
but i can t let you out of sight.
without you i am no one.
i am nothing at all.
nothing at all.
