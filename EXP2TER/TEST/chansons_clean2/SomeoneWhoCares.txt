every street in this city.
is the same to me.
everyone s got a place to be.
but there s no room for me.
am i to blame.
when the guilt and the shame.
hang over me.
like a dark cloud that.
chases you down.
in the pouring rain.
it s so hard.
to find someone.
who cares about you.
but it s easy enough to find.
someone who looks down on you.
why is it so hard.
to find someone.
who cares about you.
but it s easy enough to find.
someone who looks down on you.
it s not what it seems.
when you are not on the scene.
there s a chill in the air.
but there s people like me.
that nobody sees.
so nobody cares.
why is it so hard.
to find someone.
who cares about you.
when it s easy enough to find.
someone who looks down on you.
why is it so hard to find.
someone who can keep it.
together when you have come undone.
why is it so hard.
to find someone.
who cares about you.
i swear this time.
it won t turn out the same.
cause now i have.
got myself to blame.
and you will know when we.
end up on the streets.
that it s easy enough to find.
someone who looks down on you.
why is it so hard.
to find someone.
who cares about you.
when it s easy enough to find.
someone who looks down on you.
why is it so hard to find.
someone who can keep it.
together when you have come undone.
why is it so hard.
to find someone.
who cares about you.
