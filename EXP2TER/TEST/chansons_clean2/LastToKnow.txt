she just walked away.
why didn t she tell me.
and where do i go tonight.
this isn t happening to me.
this can t be happening to me.
she didn t say a word.
just walked away.
you were the first to say.
that we were not okay.
you were the first to lie.
when we were not alright.
this was my first love.
she was the first to go.
and when she left me for you.
i was the last to know.
why didn t she tell me.
where to go tonight.
she didn t say word.
she just walked away.
you were the first to say.
that we were not okay.
you were the first to lie.
when we were not alright.
this was my first love.
she was the first to go.
and when she left me for you.
i was the last to know.
i will be the first to say.
that now i am okay.
and for the first time.
i have opened up my eyes.
this was my worst love.
you will be the first to go.
and when she leaves you for dead.
you will be the last to know.
you will be the last to know.
