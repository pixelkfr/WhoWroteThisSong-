i have been cursed.
i have been crossed.
i have been beaten by the ones that get me off.
i have been cut.
i have been opened up.
i have been shattered by the ones i thought i loved.
you left me here like a chalk outline.
on the sidewalk waiting for the rain.
to wash away.
wash away.
you keep coming back to the scene of the crime.
but the dead can t speak and there s nothing left to say anyway.
all you left behind.
is a chalk outline.
i have been cold.
in the crypt.
but not as the cold as the words across your lips.
you will be sorry baby.
some day.
when you reach across the bed where my body used to lay.
you left me here like a chalk outline.
on the sidewalk waiting for the rain.
to wash away.
wash away.
you keep coming back to the scene of the crime.
but the dead can t speak and there s nothing left to say anyway.
all you left behind.
is a chalk outline.
all you left behind.
is a chalk outline.
all you left behind.
you left me here like a chalk outline.
on the sidewalk waiting for the rain.
to wash away.
wash away.
you keep coming back to the scene of the crime.
but the dead can t speak and there s nothing left to say anyway.
all you left behind.
is a chalk outline.
