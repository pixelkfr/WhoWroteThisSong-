i reach out when i have a confession.
i reach out in desperation.
i reach out when no one is listening.
so i go looking for the next best thing.
happiness straight from the bottle.
when real life s too hard to swallow.
happiness straight from the bottle.
when real life s too hard to swallow.
i feel them judging on me for their own pleasure.
if they really knew they d know better.
that i am the one who caves under pressure.
when desperate times call for desperate measures.
happiness straight from the bottle.
when real life s too hard to swallow.
happiness straight from the bottle.
when real life s too hard to swallow.
i know there s got to be some peace in me.
but i can t find it.
i get so sick of looking.
happiness straight from the bottle.
when real life s too hard to swallow.
happiness straight from the bottle.
when real life s too hard to swallow.
too hard to swallow.
