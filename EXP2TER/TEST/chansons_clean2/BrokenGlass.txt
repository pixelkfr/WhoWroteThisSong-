all we are is broken glass.
thrown to the floor we were never meant to last.
and all we are are empty shells.
try to pick us up you are gonna cut yourself.
we march the streets at night.
looking for a thrill looking for a fight.
it was the first day of the rest of our lives.
we work fast never gonna die.
riding up the highway forty five.
we didn t know it couldn t go on forever.
all we are is broken glass.
thrown to the floor we were never meant to last.
and all we are are empty shells.
try to pick us up you are gonna cut yourself.
we fought to rule the world.
not knowing just how fragile we really were.
like it was the first day of the rest of our lives.
then the bricks began to fall.
and we can see the cracks along the wall.
we didn t know it couldn t go on forever.
all we are is broken glass.
thrown to the floor we were never meant to last.
and all we are are empty shells.
try to pick us up you are gonna cut yourself.
we believe that we can go on forever.
we believe that we can go on forever.
forever.
all we are is broken glass.
thrown to the floor we were never meant to last.
and all we are are empty shells.
try to pick us up you are gonna cut yourself.
you cut yourself.
you are gonna cut yourself.
you are gonna cut yourself.
