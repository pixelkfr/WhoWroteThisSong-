baby innocent.
is one day gonna be decadent.
prom queen miss america.
in the backseat in a pair of cuffs.
sixteen little runaway.
from the five o and you got away.
from a small town with no scene.
looking for a shot on the big screen.
expectations.
go to hell.
expectations.
go to hell.
not so innocent.
on the street hustling.
never be miss america.
in the backseat of a celica.
crashing with a deadbeat.
living large on a love seat.
in a small town no scene.
turns out it was nothing but a pipe dream.
expectations.
go to hell.
expectations.
go to hell.
rich girl wannabe.
bought a quick pick for the lottery.
watching tv with her boyfriend.
fell asleep left the ticket on the nightstand.
he stayed awake to see the ball drop.
turned it way down she never woke up.
grabbed the keys to her car in the back lot.
threw a shot of jack back left with the jackpot.
expectations.
go to hell.
prom queen miss america.
in the backseat in a pair of cuffs.
expectations.
go to hell.
never be miss america.
in the backseat in a pair of cuffs.
